3,"What is Trans Fat? How to reduce that? I heard that tras fat is bad for the body.  Why is that? Where can we find it in our daily food? Trans fats occur in manufactured foods during the process of partial hydrogenation, when hydrogen gas is bubbled through vegetable oil to increase shelf life and stabilize the original polyunsatured oil. The resulting fat is similar to saturated fat, which raises ""bad"" LDL cholesterol and can lead to clogged arteries and heart disease. \nUntil very recently, food labels were not required to list trans fats, and this health risk remained hidden to consumers. In early July, FDA regulations changed, and food labels will soon begin identifying trans fat content in processed foods."
7,"How many planes Fedex has? I heard that it is the largest airline in the world according to the www.fedex.com web site:\nAir Fleet<br />\n  <br />\n670 aircraft, including: <br />\n47 Airbus A300-600s  17 Boeing DC10-30s  <br />\n62 Airbus A310-200/300s  36 Boeing MD10-10s  <br />\n2 ATR 72s  5 Boeing MD10-30s  <br />\n29 ATR 42s  57 Boeing MD11s  <br />\n18 Boeing 727-100s  10 Cessna 208As  <br />\n94 Boeing 727-200s  246 Cessna 208Bs  <br />\n30 Boeing DC10-10s  17 Fokker F-27s"
7,"In the san francisco bay area, does it make sense to rent or buy ? the prices of rent and the price of buying does not make sense to me, mostly the rent will not cover the mortgage . Is it better to rent a house or to buy? renting vs buying depends on your goals. <br />\ngenerally thinking is that buying is better b/c the payments that would go into the rent start building equity in your home. the govt also incentivizes you to buy by making your property tax payments and mortgage interest payments tax deductible.\nhaving said that current housing status in the bay area is such that housing cost to purchase is relatively high and rental prices (compared to ownership cost) are relatively low (relative to the rest of the country). it makes lese sense to buy vs. other places.\nbottom line you should base your decision on whether you think the market will keep going up or not. the other numbers tend to even out, the main gain or loss in buying comes from appreciation/depreciation."
5,"What's the best way to clean a keyboard? I have very small stuff stuck under my keyboard and it prevents it to from working. What will be the be\nst way to clean it? There are commercial kits available, but a can of compressed air, a lint-free cloth or wipes, mild dishwashing liquid, and a vacuum cleaner with a soft brush are all you really need for a basic cleaning. \nAfter turning off your computer and unplugging your keyboard, gently shake the keyboard upside down over some newspaper to dislodge loose crumbs and particles. \nUse the can of compressed air to blow a stream of air between the keys. \nDampen a lint-free cloth with a diluted solution of dishwashing liquid and water to wipe down the keys. \nUse the vacuum cleaner brush attachment to suck away any remaining dirt or debris. <br />\nIf you have a membrane-type keyboard (it doesn't have a spring under each key) and the keys are truly grungy, you can remove the keys with a small screwdriver and use cotton swabs and 90% isopropyl alcohol to get it sparkling clean. If you are still feeling industrious, next you can tackle cleaning your mouse. \nOf course, if cleaning your keyboard seems a truly undesirable task, you can always buy a new one for around $20."
2,"Why do people blush when they are embarrassed? Why do people blush when they are embarrassed? from ask yahoo...\nhttp://ask.yahoo.com/ask/20040113.html\n<<Blushing is a unique blend of evolutionary and social behavior. It's an involuntary reaction of the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our ""fight or flight"" response, but blushing is solely triggered by social cues. <br />\nPeople generally blush when they're feeling embarrassed, scared, or stressed. As a result of the ""fight or flight"" response, the capillaries that carry blood to the skin widen, and the increased blood flow lends the face, as well as sometimes the chest, neck, or even the body or legs, a reddened color. \nExcessive facial blushing, or erythrophobia, is caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. The condition can cause a lot of psychological duress and has engendered several support groups. \nIt's common knowledge that animals don't blush. So while there are some evolutionary cues behind blushing, it's also linked to something uniquely human -- moral consciousness.>>"
8,"Is Lin Qingxia (aka Brigitte Lin) ""the most beautiful woman in Chinese cinema?"" This is according to Stephen Chow (http://www.hkentreview.com/2005/features/kfh/kfhprem.html). Is it true? Who is the best-looking male star? Did they make any movies together? Well.  Everyone has different definition on what 'beauty' is.  I like Lin Qingxia, but I think many girls are prettier than she was. (She is more than 40 years old now). \nIf ""Lin Qingxia"" is the most beautiful woman in the Chinese cinema, the most handsome man in Chinese cinema should be ""Chin Han"" because they always made movies together.\nHowever, A male movie star once was asked his girlfriend in real life or the girlfriend in movie is more beautiful.  He gave a very good answer: ""I think my mother is the most beautiful woman in the world.""  :)"
5,"What is the origin of ""foobar""? I want to know the meaning of the word and how to explain to my friends. Not sure if this is the origin, but I think it was popularized in the 1989 film ""Tango & Cash"". After Tango, played by Sylvester Stallone, and Cash, portrayed by Kurt Russell, were thrown into jail and setup in a failed jailbreak attempt, the bad guy Yves Perret (Jack Pallance) locked them in the boiler room with a bunch of felons Tango & Cash had put in jail. Prior to unleashing a can of whoop-ass, their conversation was as follows:\nGabriel Cash: I don't know about you, but I have an aversion to getting F.U.B.A.R...\nRay Tango: What's F.U.B.A.R.?\nGabriel Cash: Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition."
2,"How the human species evolved? How the human species evolved? A tough question as it overlaps science and theology. Since you asked ""how the human species evolved?"" I'll assume you're interested in the scientific approach to the answer.\nThe current theory holds that Homo sapiens evolved from Hominid ancestors over the course of millions of years through a process called natural selection. Natural selection is the weeding and advancement of species variants over time based on the fit in that species' then current environments. The pressures for ""fit"" are competitive (with each other, with other tribes, and with other animals) and environmental (weather, terrain, availability of food, etc.). These factors all contributed to the development of our higher brain, which we now use to evolve as a global collective through communication & technology."
4,"Who said the statement below and what does it mean? Can someone help me with understanding someone else's wisdom, please?&#xd;<br><br>"" It is very easy in the world to live by the opinion of the world. It is very easy in solitude to be self-centered. But the finished man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude. "" That is kind of a tricky little quote. Sometimes placing it in context can help. This is a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay ""Self Reliance,"" which discourages basing one's opinions and actions on common opinion in favor of self-trust (see the full essay at http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm). \nI think the point of this quote is that it's very desireable to have one's own original thoughts and opinions, and to live by them.  It's easier to live by one's own convictions and not be persuaded by others when in isolation (that's the ""independence of solitude""). However, not so special to isolate oneself from others in order to attain this ideal. Because it's difficult to live by one's own thoughts and opinions while being a part of society, it's something only a ""finished man"" can truly do. Also, in the essay, Emerson refers to being childlike - unselfish, non-judgmental, open-minded, uncynical, unhesitant - as something to admire. So I think that's where the seemingly misplaced ""perfect sweetness"" comes in. When a man can remain pure of heart while living in the harsh world and also keeping and living by his own ideals. \nWhat do you think?"
4,"How do I find an out of print book? When I was a kid I remember seeing a book that was like an yearbook of all newspapers published by the Times during WW II. Each of the years is compiled into a different book. &#xd;<br>It gave one a very uniqie perspecitev into the UK druing the war, and even had advertisements from thaat time.&#xd;<br>Anybody out there know how to track such books? There are several websites that you can find rare or out of print books.  A couple would be alibris.com or abebooks.com.  These sites list books by booksellers all over the country and some internationally."
7,"What are some tips on finding a good mortgage broker? What are some tips on finding a good mortgage broker? the most basic thing is to have someone you have a decent amount of trust for. someone recommended by a friend etc.\nthe things you have to look for are:<br />\n1. top priority is seeing that the broker can actually get your loan on time. many deals fall through b/c the broker cannot get the deal through on time and has less control than the original lender<br />\n2. secondary priority is to see that they have access to competitive rates. not all brokers have access to all sources and rates, although most of them will be similar.<br />\n3. you need to see that the broker is someone you trust to get you the best rate regardless of how much money they make off the transaction."
5,"what's the best way to create a bootable windos/dos CD? i don't use floppies any more and need to boot from something other than my hard disk Well, the best way is to look at whatever program you have for burning CDs and see if it has an option to create a bootable CD.  If you can't find it, or use Windows itself to burn CDs, then it's a little more complicated.\nNote: If you find that booting from CD doesn't work, you may have to adjust your BIOS setting to allow your machine to boot from CD.\nIf you want to boot to windows: the easiest way is probably to go here: http://www.nu2.nu/bootcd/ and download a utility that will do it for you.  There are instructions there depending on what type of boot you want.\nIf you don't trust using a third party utility, Microsoft has some instructions here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167685/EN-US/ .  This process is not very straightforward though.\nIf you just need to get into your filesystem and poke around, you might consider booting a different OS.  For example, http://www.freedos.org/ (FreeDOS) and http://www.knoppix.net/ (Knoppix Linux) may do what you want.  For these, you can download ISO images and burn bootable CDs."
9,"what is the reason for the increasing divorce percentage in the western world? what is the most common parameter that causing couples to separate IMO... our lives are much more complex than our equivalents from 50 years ago and thus it's more likely for married people to grow in different directions over time (values, needs, etc.). Add to that how easy and acceptable it is to get a divorce, and how quick we are to dispose of things that we no longer want, and you get an increasing percentage.\nI wouldn't be surprised if in the not too distant future the average length of a marriage drops to ~5 years and the average number of marriages per person increases to 2+.\nA parallel to consider: how many different circles of friends do you have and how often have you joined new ones and left others behind over your life? (grade school, high school, college, jobs, etc.). We are a nomadic species. :)"
2,"What is an ""imaginary number""? What is an ""imaginary number"", and how is it treated in algebra equations? Imaginary numbers are numbers than when squared equal a negative number, as in i^2 = -1, where i is the imaginary number. You'll also often see them represented as i = √-1 (that's the square root of -1).\nDon't be confused by the poorly chosen name - imaginary numbers do indeed exist and are used in advanced math, such as in the physics of electromagnetic fields. The analogy that Wikipedia uses is a good one - just like you don't need the concept of fractions to count stones, it doesn't mean that fractions don't exist. :)"
2,"Faxing a pizza would we be able to fax a pizza in the future? How far are we from creating a machine that can beam people from one place to another? We're pretty far away from being able to beam anything in the way that you are describing.  There are some experiments where splitting entangled electrons allows us to observe some interesting 'action at a distance' effects, but the amount of data that would need to be stored to transmit something with as many atoms as a pizza is incredible.  Also, such an operation would require nano-assemblers that could interpret such data an reassemble the pizza from the info provided."
8,What are good sources to find out about new gospel artists? Is there a site that focuses primarily on gospel? CCM Magazine or their online website will give you information on up and coming artists in the Christian Music field.
2,"space missions Why are we spending so much money on space when we do not have a decent health insurance to all the public? You also need to consider the economic effects of funding basic research.  The moon missions of the 60's inspired an entire generation and helped to move many kids toward careers in science and engineering.  As a result, the US was well poised to take advantage of the huge boom in information technology in the last few decades.  The net effect of these engineers in the workforce could be see has a pretty impressive return on investment for the cost of those missions."
2,"How a black hole is formed? I would like to know how a black hole can possibly be formed. Are there any experimental evidence of such creation? The current scientific theory holds that black holes are formed when stars of sufficient mass (about 3x the mass of our Sun) reach the end of their life and collapse down into a singularity, which is, in essence, an infinitely small point with a huge amount of gravity - gravity so powerful that not even light can escape it's pull if it gets too close. It is also thought that black holes can be formed from smaller masses if external energy/pressure is exerted to squeeze the mass into a singularity.\nNot sure if there's any direct experimental evidence of creation, but there is evidence that they exist. Cosmologists use several different methods to detect blacks holes, such as by looking for light being bent and/or disappearing as it travels from remote stars towards us, and also by looking for bursts of x-rays that are given off as matter is sucked into the back hole and destroyed.\nFun fact: current evidence and theory suggests that the center of the Milky Way is a giant black hole that was formed as the densly packed stars in the center collapsed and sucked each other in."
2,"Heavy water what is the role that heavy water plays in the nuclear explosion process? Heavy water is like regular water except that instead of two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom (H20) it has two deuterium atoms and an oxygen atom (D20). Deuterium is a hydrogen atom with an extra neutron.\nWater is used in nuclear reactors to moderate the reaction speed, and to absorb heat. Nuclear fission starts by giving off neutrons that create a chain reaction. Any water around it absorbs those neutrons (becoming heavy water) and slows the reaction. If heavy water is used instead of regular hydrogen water, the neutrons are not absorbed. This means that less pure nuclear material can be used to sustain a reaction. For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium."

2,Is a transponder required to fly in class C airspace? I've heard that it may not be for some aircraft.  What are the rules? the answer is that you must have a transponder in order to fly in a class C airspace.
4,How to get rid of a beehive? Who can tell me how to get rid of a beehive with out getting stung? Call an area apiarist.  They should be able to help you and would most likely remove them at no charge in exchange for the hive.  The bees have value and they now belong to you.
7,"Nice apartment building near SBC Park? Any recommendations for a nice apartment building in SF generally in the SBC Park area? I can't tell you which of the many are best, but I can tell you about one I lived in briefly.\nI lived for a month in the Avalon at 4th and King. I was put up there as a corporate apartment. While it was fine, it was relatively expensive, and the rooms were small. It also had one of those rooms that served as kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. I'm not fond of these kinds of rooms, which are particularly American. The smell of cooking, people watching TV, people eating -- these all seem like activities that should be separated from one another. Call me old fashioned.  \nThe Avalon had a big gym, however, which was very good, and concierge service, which was very convenient. Most of them were very friendly. One concierge even hugged me when we left and said she was going to miss me!  Also convenient was its proximity to the Caltrain, the Safeway across the street and the Starbucks. But if you crave culture, this ain't it: everything is a chain store nearby.\nSo depending on your budget, your need for convenience and culture, and your tolerance for small rooms and/or omnirooms, it may suit you."
2,"What are world's 3 smallest nations? i.e.&#xd;<br>which is the smallest nation?&#xd;<br>which is the next one in size?&#xd;<br>and then the next one?&#xd;<br><br>How did they manage to become countries? 1. The Vatican City in central Rome ranks as the smallest nation of the world. It measures 0.17 square miles.<br />\n2. Monaco. <br />\n3. San Marino.\nHow did they manage to become countries?<br />\n1. The political freedom of the Vatican is guaranteed and protected by Italy. It concordat between the Holy See and the kingdom of Italy signed in 1929 in the Lateran Palace, Rome, by Cardinal Gasparri for Pius XI and by Benito Mussolini for Victor Emmanuel III.<br />\n2. Monaco came under French protection in 1861. However from 1911, when the first constitution was promulgated, the prince of Monaco was an absolute ruler.<br />\n3. According to tradition, Marino, a Christian stonecutter from Dalmatia, took refuge (4th cent) on Mt. Titano, the chief geographical feature of present-day San Marino. By the mid-5th cent., a community was formed; because of its relatively inaccessible location and its poverty, it has succeeded, with a few brief interruptions, in maintaining its independence. In 1631 its independence was recognized by the papacy."
7,"What is the best riddle that you know? I'm trying to have a library of the best riddles that people encountered. So a good riddle would be a riddle that has no ugly tricks in it- pure logic answer – no tricks, no funky solutions. If you were standing in front of a door, one leading to heaven and one leading to hell, neither of which are labeled, and guarding that door is a guard, one who always lies and one who always tells the truth, but you don't know who's who, what question would you ask to definitively know which one is the door to heaven versus hell.\nanswer: ""what would the other guard say that you would say is the door to heaven (hell)?"" then you know the opposite door is the door to heaven (hell)"
7,Economics of running a restaurant? Running a restaurant looks like hard work and long hours. &#xd;<br><br>What percentage of restaurants are profitable?  And what is the average revenue and net income of a small restaurant? 90% of restaurants fail in their first year of existence. A 10% profit level for a restaurant  is considered a success. The average revenue and net income is hard to define without knowing the food concept and what type of liquor license the establishment will have: just beer and wine license or full bar license? Will the restaurant depend heavily on take out food orders or mostly dining within? The hours are very long 12 to 15 hours a day if yo will be serving lunch and dinner.
2,"Why do gas stations mix ethanol into gas? Why do gas stations mix ethanol into gas? Right.  Fuel additives are helpful for reduction of emissions, although they are not always economical.  For the most part, the US congress has subsidized the creation of ethanol, which tends to be a net cost unless created from waste agricultural products.\nAnother substance that has the same anti-emissions properties as ethanol is MTBE.  There has been a lot of press about MTBE recently due to its tendency to pollute groundwater."
2,"Why we are not using the sea waves to generate electricity? Giving that it is a clean and safe energy, and that almost all the time there are waves, why we are not using that to generate power Same reason solar power isn't more popular despite lots of sunshine: with current technology the cost per kwh is still much higher than for power generated with fossil fuels. As fossil fuel prices rise and technology improves so-called ""alternative"" energy sources become more cost effective, but the crossover point still appears to be several years in the future.\nForcing expensive alternative technologies on the market before they are economically viable simply raises electricity prices for homeowners--this is part of the reason CA electric rates were so far above the national average in the 1990's, opening the door for Enron and like to make their ill-fated arbitrage plays..."
6,"Why doesn't the NBA implement a minor leagues? I don't want to see any more High School kids on the court, shooting airballs and missing defensive assignments. The NBA does have minor leagues - they're called the CBA, and the International leagues. :)\nSeriously - because viewers seem to value explosiveness over efficiency, I think we're seeing a major shift in the average age of NBA players towards young athletes that are quicker, high-flying and more resilient to injury. I wouldn't be surprised at all if by the end of this decade the average age of the league allstars is well under 25."

6,"Formula1 car What makes a Formula1 car a fast car? Let me break it down-\nEngine- 3 liter V10.  Approximately 900+ hp, 19,000 rpm.  The engine weighs about 200 lbs.  It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\nBrakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\nTransmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. \nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\nTires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.  Also, no ABS at all (outlawed in 1994)."
2,"how was Einstein's General Relativity theory proven ? When was it, where was it and by whom? First, I would never say that a theory has been proven. There may be a lot of evidence that supports a theory, and as a result it may no longer be on the list of theories that are being challenged, but theories are always theories and should always be open to adjustment by new evidence. A good theory is just a collection of hypothesis, experiments and deductions that survives repeated challenge and can therefore be used to predict untested outcomes.\nNow to your question (sorry for the tangent)... I think that most physicists consider Arthur Eddington's observations of the bending of light during the 1919 solar eclipse as the first solid evidence to support Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Einstein's theory predicted that gravitational fields would bend light, and Eddington's measurements supported that prediction, thus making it the first empirical data to support the theory."

2,"how does a helicopter fly this is a miracle- I always wanted to learn to fly one of those. Can someone explain how can it get airborne? A helicopter gets its power from rotors or blades. When its rotors are spinning, a helicopter doesn't look much like an airplane. But the rotor blades have an airfoil shape like the wings of an airplane. So as the rotors turn, air flows more quickly over the tops of the blades than it does below. This creates enough lift for flight."

But then somehow it was decided to add PSU as the 11th Big-Ten school.&#xd;<br><br>Any thoughts/insight on why the name of the conference not changed? i would think to keep the ""brand"" recognition and the history of the Big Ten. the conference has invested a lot in building the Big Ten name as well as any merchandising and corporate sponsorship."
3,"How effective is massage in relieving stress? How effective is massage in relieving stress? Massage is good for relieving stress if you find the right kind of you. \nOne of the most popular massages is Swedish massage. Light to medium pressure is applied with long, soothing strokes. Sometimes stress can cause muscle pain. Deep tissue massage can be tailored to the person's need. Aromatherapy massage makes use of the therapeutic effect of essential oil combined with a relaxing massage. Warm stone massage has become very popular in the past few years. Reflexology is a special form of foot massage.\nIt may take a few trials to find the right kind of massage for you. Once you find it, it can help maintain good physical health and stress reduction."

2,"Capturing light in a container Can we capture light in a container? Will it run and shine forever? What kind of internal material we should use in order to do that? So the answer to your specific question is 'no'.  The problem is that if the container shines, it means that light and energy is being lost and will eventually run out.  There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\nNow, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.  The photons that come out afterwards have the same configuration and quantum state as what went in, but whether they are exactly the same photons is more of a question for philosophy than for physics."
7,"When will Google buy Yahoo? The two businesses are very complementary in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Do we want to beat ourselves up competing with each other for resources and market share, or unite to beat MSFT? Their respective market caps are too close for this to ever happen.\nInterestingly, many reporters, analysts and tech pundits that I talk to think that the supposed competition between Google and Yahoo is fallacious, and that they are very different companies with very different strategies. Google's true competitor is often seen as being Microsoft, not Yahoo. This would support your claim that they are complementary."
2,"Do animals have feelings? can an animal feel regrets , compassion, sad, fear etc? It's clear that humans and animals (especially those close to us in the evolutionary tree), share similar chemical responses in their brain when faced with highly emotional situations.  Whether it be fear, contentment, mating urges, we have a lot of analogous mechanisms going on.  On this basis alone, there is a pretty strong argument that animals have feelings.\nOne possible counter-argument, however, is based on the definition that for certain chemical responses to be called feelings, that the being in question needs to have a conscious awareness of their state.  With this defition, it becomes much harder to say whether animals experience feelings in the same conscious manner even though the neurochemical signatures are similar.\nMy opinion is that this definition based on conscious understanding is a little specious, as it's based on an ongoing desire by some to try to define humans out of the context of the natural world... and to claim that we are categorically better than the other animals.  \nIf the neurochemical basis for consciousness is ever discovered we'll be able to quickly check which animals have this, and I suspect we'll find that many are conscious.  If this is so, then their feelings will be as real as human ones in all senses."
4,"Is Trigonometry considered high school or college level math? I never took trig. Is it the level after calculus? In the US, Trig is normally considered as a high school level course, however, it is not a required course to graduate. I believe Algebra is the highest of the high school math courses that are required for graduation, although some schools may still only require Geometry.\nIn the US the typical sequence for math courses is Pre-Algebra, Geometry, Algebra, Trigonometry and then Calculus (which is usually taken at the high school level as Pre-Calculus, but may also be taken as full ""AP"" Calculus, where the ""AP"" stands for ""Advanced Placement"" and means that the student can get University-level credit for that course when they go to College)."
7,"Why is there often a mirror in an elevator? What is the history behind it? The purpose is functional, but it's psychological rather than mechanical.\n\nHere's an explanation, from: http://www.slyasafox.com/book/book_33.html\n\n""In the early industrial age, buildings began to spring up all over the east coast. Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. \n\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \n\nThen an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\n\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?\n\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. \n\n\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. \n\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?\n\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all."" \n\n"

They are a surprising phenomenon because gamma rays are so powerful that very few events could cause them.  They have also only been recently discovered by projects like the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and appear to be coming from all directions, not just in the galactic plane.\nThis would indicate a phenomenon that has extra-galactic origins... for example, activity inside of an active galactic nuclei, or quasars.\nBecause they happen at random intervals, abd are ephemeral (often just a few seconds), and the ""scopes"" used to capture them are not tightly directional, we don't have any instruments currently that can figure out exactly what they are.

2,"Why's watching Television so addictive? Whereas reading books isn't in general (no doubt there are some avid readers but  I am talking about the majority). I'd say that TV is more popular than books because it is multimedia and much more closely matches how we normally take in information. TV is video and audio. You can see and hear it and thus more information can be squeezed into a short amount of time while also giving a much richer experience. Next time you're watching TV, consider how much you would have to write just to completely describe a single frame.\nLast, TV is also much easier because it's a passive medium. Reading requires your brain to work harder to both read the words and then interpret them into visuals. TV is already visual and can be watched with much less focus & energy."

10,"How come the usage of alternate power generators is not more prevalent in a state like Californi One would expect that it would be of an interest of states to have alternate resources. California electricity is generated by several sources, including hydroelectric, wind, geothermal and nuclear (in addition to the more traditional natural gas).  The question is why these other sources aren't used more, and the answer is that historically, they've either been more expensive or have environmental risks of their own (esp. for nuclear).  As petroleum and natural gas sources start to get used up, and world demand for energy increases, the cost of electricity from natural gas will go up and the other sources will become more cost effective and more prevalent.\nIncidentally, solar power is another source used in California, but it's provided by individuals, not power companies.  If your house has solar power and you have the right equipment, you can sell your surplus electricity to the power company and your electric meter will literally run backward."

Dogs with curved tails are known to be chasing flies and fleas that got on their tails. Owners of the dogs found this a nuisance that all of a sudden a dog would keep chasing its tail for several hours in a week. Due to this dogs forgot their ""job"" which was to guard sheep, or pull carts, etc.\nSecondly, certain dogs go very wild if we pull their tails, even if its done playfully. They simply get mad at you, bite you or even kill you, if you are small.  Since little children always found it playful to pull the tails of the dogs and this meant a potential danger to their lives, the owners cut their tails short. \nEver thought of the word CUR-TAIL? :-)"

2,"Why do we yawn? How is it contagious... Found an interesting article on this...\nYawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing. During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. \nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a “time out” to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. \nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy."

Back in 1961, DC Comics revealed that all of their Golden Age (c. 1939-1945) characters had lived on a different Earth from their Silver Age (c. 1956-1970) characters.  Some characters (Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman) were virtually the same on each Earth, while others (The Flash, Green Lantern, the Atom) were radically different.  \nEarth 2's Superman was slightly less powerful than Earth 1's, mostly adhering to the classic ""Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound"" description.  Earth 1's Superman could travel faster than light, juggle planets, and had a host of super powers including super-breath, super-ventriloquism, and super-hypnotism.  Earth 2's Superman eventually married Lois Lane and became the editor of the Daily Star before (temporarily) disappearing in 1985's ""Crisis on Infinite Earths.""  Earth 1's Superman finished his adventures in Alan Moore's ""Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?,"" a two-parter than wrapped up and resolved some 30 years of continuity.  Both Supermen were supplanted by John Byrne's 1985 reboot of the character, which was intended to simplify that continuity and start over from scratch.\nEarth 2's Superman has reappeared twice since ""Crisis;"" once in 1999's ""Kingdom Come,"" and most recently in 2005's ""Infinite Crisis.""

6,"Why are the San Francisco 49er's Sucking so Bad Again? What's up with the team again?  Offensive line? Coaching? 1.  Poor drafting.  Between 2000-2006, the 49ers drafted 55 players. Only 8 starters on offense from all of those draft classes combined, and only four at the 'skill positions' (Barlow, Lloyd, Battle and Smith).\n\n2.  Injuries:  9 guys on IR, including starting Center, starting T, starting FS and SS, starting LB and starting TE.\n\n3.  Four different starting QBs this season.\n\n4.  Barlow not a difference maker/elite back.  His 3.3 yards per carry are actually worse than last year!\n\n5.

2,"what is the temperature on the sun and how to calculate the lost of heat per distance from it? So, what will be the distance from the sun that makes it reasonable to look for life? You might not have intended it, but your question is a lot more complex than you might have thought.  It turns out that the temperature of the sun is a function of how deep into the sun you are, with the surface temperature being about 6000 Kelvins.  To make things even more complicated, the Corona of the sun (which extends in all directions around the sun beyond the surface) is actually 1,000,000 Kelvins.\n\nThis fact is well established, but further research is required to understand *why* there is such a huge difference in temperature between the two.\n\nNow for the second part of your question:\n\nThe light intensity of the sun drops off as the inverse square of your distance from the sun.  The ""heat"" is another thing entirely, because heat is defined as the average kinetic energy of particles, and photons don't count strictly in that definition.\n\nThere are particles that come from the sun in the form of solar wind, and around the region of the Earth, they have a ""temperature"" around 1000k."

6,"Why doesn't college football have a playoff system? Every year sportswriters and fans complain about how unfair the BCS is, so what's preventing the various conferences from a playoff system? - The bowls came first and have to be dislodged\n\n- The bowl organizers control larges amounts of money.  Some of these monies are given to participating universities and their conferences. Bowl organizers do not want to risk lossing this money. And universities who frequent bowls want to be assured of still receiving the big bucks before switching. Hence bowl organizers are generally against playoffs and univerisities are only luke warm supporters.\n\n- Universities like to believe their players are really students (some actually are) and not semi-professional atheletes, so they limit the number of games per year.  Playing a game takes a lot of the players time preparing and practicing.  Also due the physical nature of the game, players need several days to recovery.  This limits games to about one every 5 days or so (about one a week). A playoff system would require the two teams meeting for the championship to play and additional 2-4 games depending on the number of teams allowed to participate in the playoffs."
8,"What kind of guitar is that? What kind of guitar is Joaquin Phoenix playing in the ""Germany"" scenes in Walk the Line?  You can see the one I mean at about 30 seconds and 50 seconds (the hangar and the music store) in the trailer on Yahoo! Movies.\n\nIt doesn't appear to have a standard sound hole, just two curved openings on either side of the strings.  It's almost like an archtop, but I can't believe it's an electric; that seems out of character and you never see him with an amp.\n\nBonus points, where can I buy one? Can't answer your question exactly, but it looks an awful lot like a Gibson archtop or a Gretsch.  You can poke around either of their websites to see guitars that look pretty similar to the one in the picture.  There are particular models of Gibson & Gretsch that have the diagonal bridge piece that appears in the movie -- Gretsch calls it a ""chromatic tailpiece"".  I didn't see that Gibson had a particular name for their version but they definitely have guitars sporting that same shape.\n\nThe one thing I'll agree with you about is that unless it's an anachronism (a modern guitar that doesn't belong in the time period depicted in the movie), it's not an electric guitar -- you can clearly see there's no obvious ""soapbar"" pickup like there would be on an archtop electric guitar (there are sneaky mics/pickups in acoustic guitars today, but I can't believe that was available then)."
6,"What is a good entry-level road bike to purchase? I am looking to spend roughly $1,500. For $1500, you're starting to get out of the ""entry-level"" stage. I have a Trek 1000 and absolutely love it. I've used it for century rides, triathlons and duathlons no problem. The Trek 1000 was about $900 CDN. The only difference in the bikes up to the $1500 range is the shifters are usually a little better (they don't stretch as easily, which makes shifting cleaner for longer). The weight and wheels are basically the same. \n\nIf you want to trim 30 sec off your race time, you might consider the more expensive bikes. But, you should be an elite athlete to really notice the difference. \n\nI'd go for a $1000 bike and spend the rest on pumps (road and home), spare tires, some nice cycling clothes, tools and a bike computer. Maybe even a trainer for home use."

Historically I believe it would be  Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who was a golfer and olympic track star.\n\nAnswers.com's bio says: "" Mildred 'Babe' Didrikson Zaharias was voted the outstanding woman athlete of the century in a 1950 Associated Press poll. Though she gained her greatest professional fame as a golfer, she rivalled Jim Thorpe in her remarkable ability to excel at nearly any sport. She began as a basketball All-American, then won two track and field golds at the 1932 Olympics. Next she turned professional and began touring the country, exhibiting her prowess in track, swimming, tennis, baseball, and even billiards. In 1935 Zaharias took up golf and excelled at that, too, winning 82 tournaments in a 20-year career. She was only 42 when she died of cancer in 1956."""
2,"Could a very powerful directional microphone pickup sounds from the past? In much the same way that a a radio telescope 'sees' past events, could a very powerful directional microphone pickup sounds from the past? In a sense, any microphone is picking up sounds from the past, due to the speed of sound. This is similar to what you mentioned with radio telescopes.\n\nThe main differences are 1) velocity -- light moves at about 1 foot per nanosecond while sound moves around 1 foot per 1/1000 second, and 2) that sound moving though a medium diffuses quite rapidly. Something really loud, like thunder, you might hear from 20-30 seconds away. For normal, everyday sounds, the delay won't be more than maybe a few tenths of a second."

2,"what are the materials that can be used to produce laser beam? what are the differences between the those beams? Materials that form an inverse energy distribution?  Not quite.\n\nThere are three basic components for getting a laser to work.  First, one needs an excitation source (pumping source) such as a flashlamp, an electrical spark, etc.  Second, one needs a material (the gain medium) which can exhibit what's known as population inversion - the capacity for a material to raise the electron energy level from the lower to the upper energy states.  Nearly all materials will exhibit this behavior with some more efficiently than others.  Finally, one needs to direct the stimulated energy by using a resonator.\n\nThere are many combinations of pump sources, lasing materials and optical configurations depending on the intended use.  There are solid state (ruby, Nd:YAG), gas (nitrogen, helium-neon) and semiconductor (gallium-arsenide) lasers that come in a variety of wavelengths (colors) to choose from, again, depending on what you want to do with it.\n\nJust a little bit of background: My degree is in Physics, and I've been working in the lasers and electro-optics field for the past 10+ years.

2,"Is there any proven evidence that Mars at some point in the past had microscopic life? what supports this theory? The answer to your question is no.  There is no absolutely definitive evidence to date.  We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface, and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground, and under heavy packs of ice.    There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.  Given this, and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts, Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago.  Still, we're not sure if life exists or every existed there.    The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there.  Methane can be created by non-biological processes, but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars.  Another possible explanation would be a biological origin for the gas, potentially from colonies of microscopic organisms in the soil.    Given our current rate of deepening understanding, we will likely solve this mystery sometime in the next 50 years, but as of now we simply don't have enough evidence to constitute ""proof"""

1,"If God is both all loving and all powerful, how can he/she/it allow suffering to exist? Please, none of those ""it's beyond our understanding"" answers.  I want some real answers here! Frankly, the answers thus far show a complete lack of understanding of basic theodicy and even the Christian Bible.  Assuming that – as a Christian – you buy into Job’s tale as at least allegorical, then there is acknowledgement that you cannot know the mind of G-d.  To attempt to do so is itself blasphemous.  To attempt know the mind of G-d is to be G-d, yet we are admonished when G-d responds to Job, not with an explanation for Job's suffering but rather with a question: Where was Job when G-d created the world?\n\nAnd it was said:\nJob 40 \n1 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job and said:\n2 Shall a reprover contend with the Almighty? He who reproves God, let him answer it.\n3 Then Job answered Jehovah and said:\n4 Behold, I am vile! What shall I answer You? I will put my hand to my mouth.\n5 Once I have spoken, but I will not answer; yea, twice, but I will go no further.\n6 ¶ And Jehovah answered Job out of the tempest and said:\n7 Now gird up your loins like a man, and I will question you; and you make Me to know.\n8 Will you also set aside My judgment; will you condemn Me so that you may be justified?\n9 And have you an arm like God; or can you thunder with a voice like His?\n10 Adorn yourself with majesty now, and with grandeur, and clothe yourself with glory and honor;\n11 pour forth the outbursts of your anger; yea, look on everyone who is proud, and bring him down low;\n12 look on everyone who is proud, and humble him, and trample the wicked in their place;\n13 hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in darkness.\n\nKnow that to contend to know G-d is to set yourself above him.\n\nA previous answer blasphemed: “G-d desires that we do not suffer, but as a result of the choices men made we have suffering.”\n\nAnd also: “But there is a plan to alleviate the suffering. And that is through redemption.”\n\nLies.  \n\nAnd “John 3:16”?!  I think that means “go Broncos.”\n\nAn alternative explanation is the easy one:  there is no G-d.  You either believe that, or you blaspheme in the attempt to understand Him."

5,"What are the best ways to incentivise people to answer questions here? Appeal to their ego? wallets? sense of belonging? or something else? I think that, though counterintuitive, one of the most effective ways was to limit the number of questions a user can answer per day. A casual user will still answer the 11th question the next day, and more hard-core users will try to answer as many questions as allowed. For this to work, the limit has to be pretty small, at least starting out, so that it is reasonably easy for someone with other commitments to achieve it. Setting a small limit also requires users to choose which questions they most want to answer, which increases the likelihood that their answers will be useful. When more answers are useful, it increases the usefulness of the service, which in turn ""incentivizes"" people to answer questions. And by placing a premium on the number of questions a user can answer per unit time, the likelihood that the user will throw him/herself into it full-throttle but then quickly become bored is also decreased.\n\nSee my answer to the question, ""Why am I only allowed to answer 10 questions a day here?"":\n\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005120801767\n\nOn the issue of the term ""incentivize""--it is shameless corporate-speak, but it describes an impersonal, profit-oriented process. To attempt to use softer language to describe something that is inherently cold, calculating, and opportunistic (though not necessarily bad or wrong) would constitute euphemism, and would be both misleading and dangerous."

Remember, people evaluate how much they like or dislike you based upon the quality of the experience they have in your presence.

Would it still be compatible with my aluminum cyclocross frame? The 26"" wheels won't work. They're slightly smaller in diameter than a 700c wheel–that's what cyclocross frames are built to take. Back in the late 80's/early 90's you could get clamp-on cantilever brake mounts from Moots, but I don't know that they make those anymore. And regardless, if you were to do that, you'd also be dropping the overall height of your bike. This in turn would mean that your bottom bracket would also be lower to the ground. That's counterproductive in terms of cyclocross applications, where you want a higher bottom bracket than you would on a road bike (for clearence issues).\n\nThere's some good general information on equipment on Dave Carr's Cross Page (listed below).

If not, what are the attributes that are being selected for/against in humans these days? Evolution is ever-present as always. You could argue it's rate is a function of environment change. So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead. Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.\n\nGiven that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?\n\nIs average height an example of this? It would certainly seem that humans are growing taller on average, and what western (cultural bias) woman does not want a tall mate for example. It should be noted however that who we think is desirable for sex is very culturally dependent and may not lead to the best long-term (breeding) prospects for an individual conceived to those parents."

The Sarbanes-Oxley act was sponsored by Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Michael Oxley, and is a response to the auditing scandals surrounding Enron, WorldCom, and others.  Essentially it aims to protect investors by requiring public companies to adhere to certain standards around auditor independence, information integrity, and greater financial disclosure.\n\nFrom an IT perspective S-Ox compliance revolves around preserving information and ensuring that the systems that maintain financial records are capturing all the correct data.  Of course, S-Ox compliance can be rather complex and counterintuitive, so there are plenty of consultants who earn a living by making companies S-Ox compliant, as it is a requirement for all public companies."

The 1918, 1957 and and 1968 flu pandemics can be traced back to bird flu mutating with human virus. These pandemics killed scores of people. The panic also stems from the fact that there is no vaccine for H5N1 virus, the bird flu that is currently affecting Asia. Like last year, vaccines for ""regular"" human flu are in short supply as well.\nUnder normal circumstances, when the flu hits you're just feverish, achey and fatigued for a few days.

Generally, film geeks tend to come down in favor of Vertigo or Notorious, but the previously mentioned North By Northwest gets a lot of votes, too.\n\nNotorious is usually cited by European critics because of the amazing work by both Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, plus it is the film that introduced the concept of the McGuffin. Essentially, this is the plot device that everything seems to be hinging upon while the story is doing something else (much sneakier) in the background. In Notorious, the McGuffin is (are) the wine bottles full of uranium.\n\nI tend to think that Vertigo is his best because it's just so damn unbelievable and over-the-top but he still pulls it off. Jimmy Stewart was never better in his whole career and the cinematography, music and mood is just amazing.\n\nOther (not yet mentioned) great Hitchcock films that you must see would be:\n\n1. Early Period: The Thirty-Nine Steps (1939), The Lady Vanishes, Strangers on a Train\n2. Middle-Period: The Trouble with Harry (very funny), Suspicion, Rebecca\n3. Later: Rear Window, and Psycho (of course)"

It depends on what you mean by ""save a lot of money"".  If you are trying to save money over a period of time, it depends.  Over the long haul you might save money by buying, since you'll end up owning the property and could sell it and recover your investment.  You might even make money by buying if you live in an area where the property value is likely to go up over the period of time you might live there.\n\nIf you're trying to save money on a monthly basis, renting is usually cheaper, unless a) you might rent out one or more rooms, thus off-setting your out-of-pocket monthly expenses, or b) you can afford to put down a large down-payment.\n\nLiving in a high-cost area myself, I say ""buy"" if you can afford it.

I remember from physics class in college that two correlated wavefunctions (e.g., sum of wavefunction spins = 0) can exhibit strange behavior at a distance.  left alone (e.g., without measurement of wavefunctions), each wavefunction (called A & B) has a probability of 50% spin up and 50% spin down.  WavefunctionA (WF_A) is IN NEITHER state until it is ACTUALLY measured.  the moment WF_A it is measured, WF_B assumes the opposite spin with DEFINITE probability.  i understand that no information is transferred at a distance between WF_A and WF_B, but HOW does this happen.  WHAT is the mechanism that collapes WF_B into a definite spin state at a distance? I am not looking for explanations like ""satisfies laws of conservation"" ... instead i am looking for physical mechanism that allow this seemingly incredible phenomena to work.  If the ""weirdness"" i am describing is an artifact of the way i am asking the question (which is what i suspect), explainations there would be appreciated as well. An equally valid question would be ""what is the mechanism that causes WF_A to collapse when it is measured?""  The schroedinger equation does not predict collapse as a result of any interaction, so it is outside the theory taught in undergraduate classes.  There is no accepted theory (or in my opinion, any reasonable theory at all) as to why measurement causes a selection of a single eigenvalue out some non-eigenstate.  The idea that measurement on one object has ramifications on another object seems more mysterious, but it's not fundamentally different than the idea that measurement causes collapse in the first place.  You won't find a satisfying answer."

For household we have 110 V, 220 V.\nFor high voltage lines: 11 KV, 22 KV , 33 KV etc. 110 Volts is nominal and may vary when measured by a voltmeter.  That said, power is supplied using sets of three separate parallel wires that you can see up on most power poles.  The very high voltage there is stepped down using a transformer to supply most houses and businesses with a usable lower voltage.  The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb.  The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range.  Houses do not use all three wires.  A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.  Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention.  Incidentally there may be an additional single wire above all the rest to arrest lightning strikes."

But I thought the gum is the flesh connecting the teeth to the jaw, and I can see the entire pink flesh covering my teeth. There must be at least 1.5cm. How can it be less than 4mm? Am I missing something? The 4 mm probably refers to the depth of your gum pockets (the space betwen the top of your gums to the alveolar bone that holds your teeth. Your dentist would measure this with a probe.\n\nIf your pockets are deeper than 4 mm then it means that you have had bone loss  which is usually caused by periodontal disease (an infection in the gums). The best way to prevent periodontal problems is to brush and FLOSS your teeth regularly (brush at least twice a day for two minutes). \n\nI emphasize flossing, because often people don't realize just how important it is. The contact between the two teeth are where food are most likely to get stuck, and therefore where bacteria sticks most often, too. The purpose of flossing is to really clean that surface where two teeth touch. So instead of focusing on just making the floss go down between the teeth, you want to follow the sides of your teeth to make sure you remove the plaque. So you should be going up and down two to three times along the tooth on both sides of the contact.\n\nHope this helps!"

You can use of of the many php MVC Framework. One of the most used one is phpMVC. \n\nQuoted from their website ""php.MVC implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, and encourages application design based on the Model 2 paradigm. This design model allows the Web page or other contents (View) to be mostly separated from the internal application code (Controller/Model), making it easier for designers and programmers to focus on their respective areas of expertise.\n\nThe framework provides a single entry point Controller. The Controller is responsible for allocating HTTP requests to the appropriate Action handler (Model) based on configuration mappings.\n\nThe Model contains the business logic for the application. The Controller then forwards the request to the appropriate View component, which is usually implemented using a combination of HTML with PHP tags in the form of templates. The resulting contents are returned to the client browser, or via another protocol such as SMTP.\n\nphp.MVC is a PHP port of Jakarta Struts. It currently supports many features of Struts, including declarative application configuration via the XML digester. For example, mappings from the various Action business logic components to appropriate results pages can be specified declaratively in the XML configuration file. """

With current mortage rate, buyer are still willing to pay premium for houses.  Clearly, easy money are still out there. I think there is a lag in new home sales and the closings in October really were under contract in Aug and September, thus November numbers should be down dramatically even after seasonal adjustment. Rates will undoubtedly go up again at the next meeting, but with the advent of so many new mortgage products (interest only, reverse mortgage, etc.) money is still relatively easy but definitly more risky. I expect volume levels to slow, prices to flatten across most of the US but do not see a big drop in prices unless rates get above 8%."

4,"Parttime MBA or Certification in Management, which one is better. Where can I do the Mgmt. certification from. As as working professional I dont have time to goto college. I want to do either the Part Time MBA or Certification in Mgmt. Which one has more value and what would you recommend for me? You see, one of the biggest value an MBA will bring is the ""networking"" opportunity. Hence, a part-time MBA with no classroom-based activities will miss this important piece.\n\nIf you want to go for a fully remote-based degree, the Open university is a good option.\n\nColumbia also has a good option for a certificate: you keep taking several courses and after some time you can apply for a certificate in business excellence.\n\nI think both the part-time mba or the certificate are good options if you pick a good school.\n\nIf you can afford going to the campus about twice a month, an executive mba is the best option in my opinion. Chech NYU, Kellog or Columbia."

I seem to remember reading somewhere that in the old sled/carriage days that if a fellow teamster had to bail you out of trouble, you traditionally gave them your sleighbells as a thank you (or mark of shame?).  Can't find that reference any more. Direct quote from http://www.rootsweb.com/~genepool/meanings.htm: ""To be somewhere with ""bells on"" refers to a practice peddlers had when they roamed the area west of the Appalachians selling wares. To avoid Indians, they traveled as silently as possible until they reached a settled area. Then they unmuffled bells hung around their horses necks to announce their arrival to outlying cabins. Hence, ""I'll be there with bells on."" The peddlers' arrival was a much anticipated major event in the mostly tedious and hard lives of settlers, not only for the goods they sold, but also for the news, letters, and messages they carried from the outside world."""

You want one of the dockable tuners, all of them have some sort of line out capability.  After that the prime factor is form factor and UI.  I prefer the look of the Clarion but the JVC and Audiovox are also good.

I figure why pay TiVo or a cable company or a satellite company to use a personal video recorder, after all, it's just a piece of timer software that records data to a hard drive. Just a matter of getting the tv listings, hooking up a home computer and finding the right software for one-time up front cost (something cheap, like $50 and not 300-500 like TiVo/ReplayTV charge you). Easy, SnapStream, or I think it's now called BeyondTV, there was an article written on it in 2002 on tomsnetworking.com, great article: http://www.tomsnetworking.com/network/20020423/\n\nA little more than $50, but $69.99 ain't bad. If you don't already have a tv tuner card for your PC then get the bundle that comes with it.\n\nI'm not sure but I think the XP Media Edition PCs have similar software already built-in as well."

6,"What are the advantages of a compact crankset over a triple on a bicycle? I'm considering switching out my triple crankset for a compact. I tried a rental bike with a compact (Cannondale R2000, nice bike) and liked it quite a bit. Right now I'm riding a Specialized Roubaix with Shimano 105 components.\n\nI'm something of a beginner, having just started about three months ago. I have a climber's build and tend to like moderately hilly routes. The main advantage is that the compact crankset gearing is much closer to the high cadence riding that is the current trend in modern cycling.  With a standard triple crank you have 30/42/52 chainrings, from which most people use the 42 and 30 rings.  The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.  The 42 is   a bit too small for barrelling down a hill, and the 52 is so steep that it's rarely being used.\n\nThe compact crankset has 50 and 34 tooth gears which are theoretically better for the way most cyclists ride today.  The 34 gives you short enough gearing to get up big hills but is not quite as short as the granny gear on the triple, and the 50 gives you the speed in a manageable dose.\n\nA couple things to consider, though.  In order to switch to a double compact, you need to replace a fair number of components, including the bottom bracket, cranks, rear derailleur (optional but highly recommended), front derailleur and possibly your left shifter.  You might be able to get what you want from switching out the cassette on your bike, which is of course a lot cheaper."

Statistically Michael Schumacher is the best, though it's not an apples to apples comparison as the car is a much larger factor in driver success than it has been in the past.  My vote's with Ayrton, he had a razor sharp focus that I haven't seen since, and F1 in the early 1990's was much more competitive than it is today."

I recently purchased a new DSLR camera and a new photo printer, and I'm ready to replace an older (smaller) monitor.\n\nHow much better are the monitors above $1000? The problem with most current LCD technology is that the chrominance isn't as good as with traditional CRT-based monitors. There are some LCD ones just coming out that have full-color backlight which should make them actually _better_ than CRTs (according to some Wired article I read, anyhow.)\n\nPersonally, I've been pretty happy with the Dell 24xx monitors - they're under $1k, they have a multitude of inputs, and I think I've only got one stuck pixel (and no dead ones.) You're still going to have to color-correct anyway, but you'd have to do that on _any_ monitor you get. (A good gamma correction curve will solve a multitude of ills.)"

2,"what is the fibbonacci sequence? how has the fibbonacci sequence been used by sculptors, architects,and painters Well, many people answered the question. Fibonacci sequence starts from 0 and Nth Fibonacci Number is sum of (N-1) th and (N-2) th Fibonacci Number.\nSequence goes like 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34…....\n\nIt is an empirical fact that the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci Numbers converges to an interesting value near to 1.6 called (to be accurate it is (1+SQRT (5))/2) golden ratio or golden mean.\nThere ere are some interesting facts about golden ratio:\n1.\nThe growth of nautilus shell, growth of populations and many other kinds of natural “growing,” are somehow governed by mathematical properties exhibited in the Fibonacci sequence. Not just the rate of growth, but the pattern of growth. Examine the crisscrossing spiral seed pattern in the head of a sunflower, for instance, and you will discover that the number of spirals in each direction is invariably two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.\n2. \nGolden ratio is related to construction of great ancient architectures like Great pyramids in Egypt. \nLink: http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit2/unit2.html\n3.\nYou can follow this link for exploring its use in poetry, music, art and now a days it is used for stock market predictions as well. This link will tell you the origin of the word Fibonacci as well.\nLink: http://www2.evansville.edu/studiochalkboard/cm-fibonacci.html"
4,"How did language start? Especially the English language.. who define the ABCDE.... Language predates the alphabet. The origins of Language are lost to the mists of time. The alphabet as we know it was developed by the Phonecians about 3000 years ago, and modified first by the Greeks, and then the Romans for their own languages before we adopted it from the Romans.\n\nThe origins of the English language specifically date to sometime after 1066 when Willam the Conqueror became King of England. The commoners spoke something related to the ancestor language of Dutch while the nobility spoke French. We kept the grammar of the native Anglo-Saxon tongue while adding huge amounts of French vocabulary.\nThe result is recognizably English, while still sounding very different from what we speak today. It's not until Shakespear's time that Modern English emerged."

9,"6th Wedding Anniversary - Any Ideas? My husband and I will be celebrating our 6th wedding anniversary next Friday. I would love to do something special for him, but we are a little limited on funds. What can I do to make this night special? \n\nI would love to hear some ideas from some of you! \nThank you in advance! :) My favorite times with my loved one is when we actually have time to sit and reflect about what the other one means to us. Going out to eat is traditionally what is done on an anniversary, but I prefer one on one time where there is nobody else around. No strangers talking loudly, no waiters to interrupt, no time wasted in line or in the car.  \n\nIn my opinion, Anniversaries are about each other, and to do that, you've gotta block out the rest of the world.  Here's my recipe for a fabulous anniversary. FIRST, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, GET SOME PAPER, PENS, AND AN ENVELOPE. I'll tell you why in a little bit.\n\nNext, plan the environment - Stay home (or rent a hotel if you want to get away from the day-to-day). Turn off the lights, turn on the music, light the candles.  Put your favorite (but easy to prepare) foods around you - cheeses, pizza, strawberries, chocolate, wine, etc.\n\nNow here comes the important part - sit directly in front of each other on the floor. Knee to knee, and eye to eye. Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. Before you know it, hours will have passed. Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. \n\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. How they make you feel, and why you love them. Why you appreciate them. The more specific you get the better. For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. Now don't let the other person read it. Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. \n\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\n\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\n\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think?"

Feel free to comment or suggest corrections via e-mail. Working together we can end some of the historical misinformation about Native Americans. You will find the ego at this end is standard size. Thanks for stopping by. I look forward to your comments...Lee Sultzman]\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLocation\nOriginal: \n\nThe southern Appalachian Mountains: including western North and South Carolina, northern Georgia and Alabama, southwest Virginia, and the Cumberland Basin of Tennessee, Kentucky, and northern Alabama.\nCurrent: \nDistributed across the United States, but concentrated in eastern Oklahoma. The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\n\nPopulation\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\n\n\nName\nThe most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word ""Chelokee"" meaning ""people of a different speech."" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) ""principal people"" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) ""people of Kituhwa."" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\n\n\nLanguage\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\n\n\nSub-tribes\n\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \nLower"

Yes, Koreans in North Korea and South Korea both speak Korean.  However, since the countries have been separated for some time and haven't had much contact, you can expect that some new dialectical differences are developing.  However, my guess is that probably some different dialects of Korean were present in different regions even before the country got split up."

I'll strongly recommend you to check KaplanMedical.com for online education on Step 2 and USMLEWorld.com for a good bunch of QBank. The best book to start with is First Aid for USMLE Step 2 CK.

But somebody realised the same thing could be done from Earth via an orbiting space station for a fraction of the cost.\nThe only other reasons for going to the moon were - \n1. To stop the Russians setting up a military base there.\n2. To collect moon rocks.\nWhen the US realised that a Russian moon base wasn't practical, and they had souvenired as many moon rocks as they were ever likely to need, they never bothered to go back."

Over the past couple of years, I made many friends from China - most of whom are raised with no religion. And they're all great and wonderful individuals who don't seem to lack anything. I have had at times to explain certain things about the Christian religion to them, which is the dominant religion in the western world, and its practice can raise questions to the uninitiated.\n\nIf you seek spirituality, you should not limit your self to exploring one religion. Why do you dismiss Buddhism, Taoism etc? You should read about everything, speak to ministers and allow your self to form an opinion.\n\nMy advice is, to not let anyone convert you into something by sweet talking you, or promising the kingdom of God. Learn, and let it be your choice. If I were in your shoes, I would try to get all the facts and then decide on my own.\n\nMeet religious people and ask them how they practice religion and what it means to them. Your safest choice not to be tricked into a cult etc would be to go for a well established and long standing dogma or denomination.\n\nIn Christianity, since that is your question, the major two denominations are Catholic and Orthodox, which both came after a separation of the church between west (Catholic) and east (Orthodox). You can learn more on different religions by following the links below.\n\nI know in China most Christians are unitarian, since in 1949 the Government forced denominations to form one single church or leave China.\n\nRemember learn before you act, and don't let anyone influence you. My opinion is that once you decide on something you should stick by it. Should you make the conscious choice to have Faith in a religion. So being absolutely certain is essential. Changing religions in the manner you'd change shirts is not ideal. Because then Faith - which is the most important element in every religion - never gets too strong to mean anything in your life.\n\nWhatever choice you make - good luck to you!"

4,"Is Yahoo or Google a better resource for research? What is another good resource for academic research? Thanks. My answer is google for the following reasons:\n\nPros of Google:\n\nAs a seach engine, google has the best relevance and presents the results in a way that I find easy to decide what pages are best for me. Its the best in terms of researching information.\n\nFor makin money, a #1 on google is worth many times more than a #1 on yahoo. Yahoo! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.\n\nGoogle also has a neat interface. Yahoo is not bad too, but its interface is not that neat. The reason for that being it to be a portal. I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.\n\nThe relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky' feature pretty useful. Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.\n\nGoogle has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.\n\nCons of Google:\n\nHowever, few problems with google, its web crawler dosen't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net, a feature which Yahoo provides.\n\nAlso, Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler, a feature which Altavista provided since 1999. The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\n\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs. Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush's name, the #1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.\n\nYahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies, for example Grokker.\nhttp://www.grokker.com/grokker.html?query=Anirudh%20Koul&Yahoo=true&Daypop=true&numResults=250"

Does anyone have a Tivo sucessfully setup this way?  Which adapter are you using? I successfully used a Belkin F5D6050 2.4 GHz 802.11b wireless USB adapter with TiVo. Make sure your SSID and WEP encryption key match your wireless router. If that still doesn't work, try connecting the wireless adapter to a laptop in the same location as your TiVo to make sure you actually have a signal. If that doesn't work, or if you get fed up with cordless phones knocking you off (like me), consider a pair of PowerLine Ethernet bridges and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter for the TiVo (see www.tivo.com/adapters for compatibility)."

5,"how is the RIAA catching individuals downloading pirated music? How are they getting these people they are suing?  Are they tracking IPs, are they watching torrents, P2P, how are they doing it? The short answer is, yes, of course they are tracking IPs.  The long answer to your other question follows.\n\nIt is a straight-forward, multistep process.\n\n1. Encourage laws that require internet service and server providers to log IP addresses (9/11 pretty much nailed that one for them).\n2. Collect proof of misdeeds for each particular P2P service that is allowing illegal file copying.\n3. Sue the P2P service and demand they hand over IP addresses of offending users.\n4. Trace IP addresses back to users.  Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\n\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\n\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file.  Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\n\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. It may not be enough to find who did it but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\n\nThere is probably more going on but you get the idea. At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\n\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot. And, just as important, more evidence is accumulating which is used in court as proof of a crime being committed and intent to commit a crime on the part of the peope being sued by the RIAA - or whoever.\n\nSo, either listen to: music you buy, public domain music, music from the radio - or compose/play your own.\n\nYou probably don't like it when you found out someone copied off your test at school.  It makes them get a higher grade than they deserve and if the test is graded on a curve, your A- work can wind up being counted as a B+.  \n\nWell, songwriters composed that music and/or lyrics, musicians practiced and learned to play that song and paid to use a recording studio to perform it in.  When people don't pay to hear that play, the musicians still have their expenses to pay but no royalty check to pay for it. They lose money doing what they love.\n\nEven if someone cannot afford a whole album they can still afford to buy their favorite song for 99 cents."
3,"Does a root canal treatment pose a potential health threat? I've heard conflicting opinions. What is your personal experience? I had a root canal two years ago, and practically drove myself insane worrying about the potential health impact of it down the road.  Other than the first few days, I've never had any significant pain or discomfort.  I've come to the realization that since I'm only in my early 30's, I'd rather take the risk with a root canal and keep my tooth, rather than have it yanked and either be toothless or pay a lot of money for other options that would still involve putting foreign substances in my mouth.  So, I guess my recommendation regarding root canals would be that if you are a healthy person, with a good immune system, a root canal would probably be a good option, rather than losing your tooth.  But, I do believe they could impact your health, and the decision should be an informed one."

He's a white thin-skinned 83-yr-old man who's skin is now sensitive to sun, heat, light, TV, etc., so it even hurts to lay on the sheets in the bed. He gets cancer eruptions burnt off as they flair up but wants relief from continual ouchiness. He cant even wear his sun hat nor sun glasses anymore 'cause it hurts wherever they touch his skin. He tries to get his mind off of problems but he cant do anything without being irritated. (He already tried noxzema, uses zinc oxide, tries various skin products & soaps ...)  Any answers?? Thanks! Please listen to me as I am only here to help. You have to do exactly as I say. Go to the website and look up CESIUM CHLORIDE AND OXYGEN DROPS. The other ones could be green algae and paw paw, etc etc. These medicines are known in the medical field, but they dont talk about it. Because these are natural remedies with no toxic chemicals in it. So, thats why they cant profit from it. If they cant profit, they dont sell. I mean, some are even made of mushrooms that you can grow anywhere. Why would they promote this? These doctors will never make money. So, the FDA has put a restriction on these remedies. They cannot say anything about cancer on their labels. They have to be sold as vitamins or health products. But, the website can tell you how to use it, and what cancers it can cure. See how they are suppressing the world? In fact these treatments can cure up to 90% of patients that doctors have already given up on. Chemo therapy is not a therapy. I would rather die then go through with that. They try to kill your cancer with chemicals and radiation. If they kill all your cancer before they kill all your body cells, then they consider you cured. But, what about after that? Your body is damaged and your health deteriorated. There is almost no recovery to this. How many people you know live past 5 years after chemo therapy? Not much if any at all. And compared to the masses, its almost nothing. What do you have to live with after chemo? Your body is not sunburned, its practically microwaved. CESIUM CHLORIDE can be taken with OXYGEN DROPS. Go to the websites. You can go to these websites and they will give a whole package for you to buy. You can take these medicines over the course of 3 months, a year, or whatever they prescribe. After your mom is feeling well, taking it for about 2 months or more, you can almost garauntee that you are cured. But, you have to listen to them and take it till they tell you to stop. They even cure certain 3rd stage cancers with a 90% success rate. But, time is of the essence so I urge you to buy it as soon as possible and take next day delivery or something. I wish you the best of luck in the future. But, heed my warning, do not go into chemo. They always tell you something fuzzy like, oh..you might live another 2 years, or you might die right away..etc etc....Then how do you decide? But, they always say that people who have been on chemo will only live a maximum of X years after that.  So, if you do exactly what I say, not only will you have a chance to survive, but all your friends that may get cancer..."

I mean i've heard that joke about, ""use the best. apples for graphics, linux for servers and windows for solitaire"". I understand the joke but what is linux, who really uses it? Linux Pronounced lee-nucks or lih-nucks. A freely-distributable open source operating system that runs on a number of hardware platforms. The Linux kernel was developed mainly by Linus Torvalds. Because it's free, and because it runs on many platforms, including PCs and Macintoshes, Linux has become an extremely popular alternative to proprietary operating systems.\n\nLinux is a computer operating system and its kernel. It is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open-source development: unlike proprietary operating systems such as Windows and Mac OS, all of its underlying source code is available to the public and anyone can freely use, modify, and redistribute it.\n\nIn the narrowest sense, the term Linux refers to the Linux kernel, but it is commonly used to describe entire Unix-like operating systems (also known as GNU/Linux) that are based on the Linux kernel combined with libraries and tools from the GNU Project and other sources. Most broadly, a Linux distribution bundles large quantities of application software with the core system, and provides more user-friendly installation and upgrades.\n\nInitially, Linux was primarily developed and used by individual enthusiasts. Since then, Linux has gained the support of major corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell for use in servers and is gaining popularity in the desktop market. Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\n\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\n\n\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX"

10,"Were there any Marines that saw service in the European theater during WW II? Were they exclusive to the Pacific and the war against Japan? Shortly after the United States entered World War II, the Allies agreed that the European Theater would have priority in the war over the Pacific Theater. The Marine Corps' war was in the Pacific and all war plans regarding the employment of Marines reflected that. Nevertheless, because the Marine Corps was part of the naval establishment, it had responsibility also for furnishing men to parts of the Navy assigned to the European and Mediterranean theaters and to the operations conducted there.\n\nThese were not large Marine formations, but were, for the most part, individual Marines and small detachments assigned to guard duty at the barracks and naval operating bases established in the United Kingdom, or men assigned as ""sea-going"" Marines in the detachments of the large fighting ships. Another category was filled by those intrepid Marines who volunteered for duty with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), to undertake covert operations with the underground against the Nazis in the occupied countries of Europe and North Africa."

So they deem the amount of sex or the intensity of the act as a means of actually being with someone. Rather than establishing the relationship first and allowing the loving to be the icing on the cake. It's kind of like when we were kids and played make believe. However,the difference would be that we adventually snapped back to reality.

7,"How can I get very rich quickly and easily? 29 year old father of three who lives paycheck to paycheck in Oklahoma. Send me $1,000 and I'll get back to you (just kidding).  There are no successful get rich quick schemes. What works for one person will not work for most others.  The best and most successful way to get rich is through a successful budget plan, realistic and thoughtful goals, hard work, diversification and sacrifice.  At the age of 29 you should first learn to save some between those paychecks. Find out what you spend your money on and spend less of it.  Do not use credit except for home mortgage, and prepare for regular maintenance.  Once you are able to save you will be able to invest in inovative minimal risk investments that will grow over time.  These are and always will be the only sure fire road to wealth."

2,"Do you think you have scientific proof of evolution? I know someone who will pay you if you really do!? Ok, so you think that evolution is true. You think it's scientific. Let me tell you, it's so wrong! You've probably never heard of Kent Hovind, but he's a creationist who can prove that evolution is wrong. He has put up a challenge that if you can give him scientific proof that evolution is true, then he'll pay you $250,000! I'm serious! \n\nCheck this website: http://www.drdino.com/articles.php?spec=67\n\n(He has had this challenge for at least 10 years, and still no one has found scientific proof for evolution!)\n\nSo do you really think there is evidence for evolution??? I happen to agree that evolution may not be the way god chose to create the world. There must be an intelligent designer - the more I learn science the more I see that must be true. I've watched dr dinos vids and as a scientist I see a lot of cool stuff, but also a bunch of flaws - I loved his work on dinosaurs though.\nThe only scientific evidence for evolution that really leaves me hanging is radioisotope degradation (I can see around C14, but what about the others)\nAnyone want to explain a way around that...I'd be interested!"

Gnosticism was long thought to be a corruption of Christianity but more current thinking is that its roots are pre-Christian. It is highly unlikely, though not absolutely proveable that Jesus was not a Gnostic. The Essenes were a splinter Jewish sect so that was around during Jesus' life. There are some who believe that Jesus was an Essene. Others believe he spent some of his wilderness time with Essenes. Still others think that he never encountered yhe Essenes. Most who compare the recorded thoughts of Jesus with the recorded Essene tracts believe that they are incompatible. It is very unlikely, though not absolutely proveable, that Jesus was ever an Essene."

A language is not a tangible thing, so you'll find Portugese really hard to lean.\n\nIf you're asking about ""learning"" Portugese, it may not be as difficult as you think.  First, it'd be easier to learn compared to Arabic, Chinese or Slavic languages since the LAtin alphabet is used.  Second, it's a language of the Indo-Eurasian family, so if your first language is English, you'll have grammatical similarities and even many words of common roots (compare that to learning say an Altaic language).  Lastly, you say there are people speaking Portugese in your family, which enables you to practice it in daily life. Plus you probably already have an affinity with the sounds and the intonation of that language.\nLearning new languages is fun and eventually useful, and it is a wonderful exercise for your brain. Go for it!"

We've been knowing each other for 15 years, but throughout that duration were were together for 2 years. They were some of the best years of my life(well at least until the end). We're kind of like ""friends with benefits"", except we do other things as well. In between our dates we each from time to time go out on other dates, but it's not the same. I want him to know that I fell back in love with him and want more than what he is giving me. The only thing is that I'm afraid of rejection.I keep thinking that if he really wanted to be with me, then he would just tell me, because we are pretty close. But that's just it, he hasn't and that's why I am concerned about confronting him with my feelings.That's why I want the best possible way of going about this. All help would be greatly appreciated... You are being used for booty and will never be anything more to him. I wish it didn't sound so harsh, but that's your truth. Either enjoy your ""benefits"" or move on. You may tell him you love him, but I bet your intuition has already told you the response to that and that is why you are scared. Actually I belive you should tell him, get it off your chest....and still move on."

But if they stay for SEVERAL weeks, I feel they should start pulling their own weight; helping with the chores and maybe contributing to the food cost. If you just want them to stop acting like guests and start acting like roommates, start assigning chores and handing over the grocery lists once in a while.... ""Hey, Susan, while I'm at work today, would you please vaccuum and water the plants?"" or (In a joking tone) ""Isn't it your turn to do the dishes?""  Open bills in front of them, and complain aloud about how high they've gotten.\nIf you want your house back, then be kind but blunt... Sit down with them and say ""I have loved having you here, but I'm afraid that I can't have you stay much longer...I have XXXXX happening in a couple of weeks and need to have some time to myself before that, but it's sure been fun!""\nOr lie and tell them your landlord has reminded you of the terms of your lease and your rent will be raised if they stay more than another week.\nGood luck!"

I have bad knees so whenever I do lunges knees crack suggestions? unless the cracking is painful, it is not unusual or dangerous for your knees to ""crack"".\n\nLunges are excellent for strengthening the muscles around the knee joint. Make sure that you are not leaning over the knee, that the knee is right above the foot during the lunge and that you maintain a straight upright movement.\n\nDo not do hamstring excercises that will pull on the knee joint if you have problems with your knee. \n\nelipticals are good for running on with minimal knee and ankle stress. \n\nyou can also get large elastic bands...stand in them, and step out to the side pulling on the bands, then back in. Don't pull harder than is comfortable, this will help increase the stablization of the knee.\n\nLaying on your back you can pull your knee to your chest, and then extend it, locking your knee holding the leg just over the ground..repeating, this will also help strengthen the muscles around the knee with minimal weight on it.\n\nAlways is good to speak with a doctor or physical therapist if you have concerns."

I havn't read the comic book in about 5 years, but the last time I did read it, Psylocke was on the good side with the X-Men. Did she turn bad??? It depends.  They COULD be taking a spin off the more recent stuff where there were two Psylockes.  In the early 20's issues of X-men, there was a big brouhaha about how Revanche came back, essentially a carbon-copy (though she said she was the original!) Psylocke with the same powers, etc., but with the old-school look she had waayyyy back in the older ish of Uncanny.  However, she had a mean streak in her... \n\nI think it's entirely possible (seeing as how true to the book the previous two movies were as far as the characters go) that Psylocke would start out bad, and yet come into Xavier's fold.  You know, kinda like how Nightcrawler was in the second one...?"

Compare this situation with Ionic bond where electrns get completely transferred & the atoms get ionized (charged). So it concludes that atoms are neutral originally (Obviously).\nSo in a homolytic fission when electrons contributed by atoms are RETURNED back to them, why should they get charged ?

He wiretapps innocent americans and expects to pass it off as anti-terrorism efforts.\n6. He has started a huge 'political and religious' war against terrorists, and neglects to cover losses in the united states such as hunger, drugs, poverty, guns and hate crimes.\n7. He is staunchly against gay and lesbian rights, which as they are americans should be affored the same rights and roles as everyone else.\n8. He flaunts his power, even though he doesn't have a clue on how to use it.  His IQ is one of the lowest of any president in history; he hasn't written any of his own speeches, let alone a book about his policy and life.  In general his intelligence leaves quite a bit to be desired.\n9. He doesn't seem to care about world policy; it is his way or the highway.\n10. He has put our boarders at risk, even from the canadians.\n11. He has severed ties to some of our oldest allies, simply because some of our allies think that he has gone to far in his push for world peace.\n12. He is constantly trying to push his world agenda onto other conountries, and forcing democracy into their countries without their consent.\n13.

He doesn't aggree with the Geneva Convention, in fact he has wanted to rewrite it several times.\n16. He wants to actually remove us from our seat at the UN, which would be catastrophic to the agency as we hold a founding seat.\n17. He has invaded Iraq under false pretenses, and continously defends our rights there; whereas we should have no rights there as that is NOT our country or our protectorate, instead it is the soverign right of the iraqi people, not americans.\n18.

I started off with my Masters program in Electrical Engineering in University of Arizona, Tucson where I did four graduate level courses. Later I shifted to California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA) and did two graduate level courses in Electrical Engineering program. Now I received admission into Masters in Electrical Engineering in University of Southern California (USC) for Spring 2005. But I have found that USC would transfer only 4 units and that I would have to mostly do all the 27 units required for the Masters program in USC. That would cost me 27x1100 approx = 30,000 approx USD. Is it really worth graduating from University of Southern California spending that much money? Can I get the same job graduating from CSULA as I would get graduating from USC? As someone in the technology field in the Los Angeles area, I would have to say that the USC degree is worth more than one from CSULA, because of the quality of the professors and program. USC's EE program is much higher rated that any CS school--in fact it's ranked among MIT, Stanford, Caltech, CMU, and others as one of the top schools in the nation according to the U.S. News and World Report. (That said, I got my own degree there...) The rankings were 1. MIT 2. Stanford 3. Berkeley 4. Georgia Tech / U of Illinois Urbana 6. Univ. of Michigan 7. USC Viterbi School 8. Caltech 9.

They sure picked a bad time to open their mouths and say stupid things.  I know I won't forget what they did at this time.  What they have been doing borders on being anti-American, even treasonous.

He doesnt feel like he is ready for a relationship because he has some things he wants to make better with himself. For example, he says he wants to be different than any other guy I have dated.

I feel like no one is perfect, we all have our struggles and imperfections. I will take him as he is...flaws and all. We get along great, we are dating exclusively. I have strong feelings for him and he says that he has them for me. Is there a certain amount of time that i should wait or should I just let it go? I know that in time, feelings will only get stronger and then what?  I dont want to date anyone else...Should I just be patient?? Let him go.

Once the hardware and software are installed, simply hook the gamecube up to the Tuner card as though it were a TV, and the software will let you view the console output on your computer monitor.\n\nBasically, turn your computer into a TV and everything falls into place for hooking standard TV accessories to it."

With Geena Davis acting recently in Commander-in-Chief and almost no fiction (excepting maybe When Spirits Beckon at Amazon.com), it's surprising that there's very little discussion on the prospects of either Condi Rice or Hillary Clinton becoming the 1st female president. Even if the right supports Condi in the Presidential Cabinet, I really doubt their support would run all of the way to the Presidency. There are far to many in the ""religion right"" that would have a ideological problem with a woman being President. \n\nAs for Hillary, I think she could get a lot of support from the more liberal left, but still not enough to be elected. Not to mention there is A LOT of dirt on her. The realities of who she is would turn away all but the most liberal minded. \n\nSo yes, I think it is difficult for a female to be elected.

President Lyndon Johnson had the same type of cozy ""you bankroll me and I'll send a lot of government contracts your way"" relationship with Brown & Root as VP Cheney has with Haliburton today. Interestingly, Brown & Root bought Kellogg and became ""Kellogg, Brown & Root"", then ""KBR"", and then bought Haliburton with their massive Vietnam War profits. Haliburton IS Brown & Root, executing the same business plan that proved so successful in the 60's: put your guy into the White House (even if just as the de facto President), find a pretext for a war, have him find a way to get the US deep into the war, make MASSIVE PROFITS, PREFERABLY WITH NO-BID, COST-PLUS CONTRACTS, repeat. Except your facts are all wrong. Halliburton acquired Brown & Root in 1962, well before major US involvement in Vietnam. KBR didn't become its own entity until 2002 after the asbestos lawsuits were going full steam ahead, threatening Halliburton assets. The company spilt off KBR and placed in under bankruptcy protection.\n\nSo what is your question anyway??? It appears to be a misguided attack on the right."

If you ask a 15-year-old, in a simple answer he/she will say: “three”. Are there more dimensions beyond our understanding? Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space, the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three.\n\nTime is often referred to as the ""fourth dimension"". It is, in essence, one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that movement seems to occur at a fixed rate and in one direction. The equations used by physics to model reality often do not treat time in the same way that humans perceive it.\n\nTheories such as string theory predict that the space we live in has in fact many more dimensions (frequently 10, 11 or 26), but that the universe measured along these additional dimensions is subatomic in size. As a result, we perceive only the three spatial dimensions that have macroscopic size."

7,"why do guys hurt girls but they say they love u and would do anything for you? they are just ass holes that dont no what they want untill they lose you so why is that why do guys have to hurt you and you are really in love with them can some one answer that for me. Some guys never figure out what they really want & others think that the sole aim in life is to have someone that will sleep with them on a regular basis. There are, however, good men out there...it just normally takes them awhile to gain the maturity needed to be a partner in a relationship.\n\nWhy do they lose you & then want you back? Simple; some are incapable of seeing how good a thing they had until it is gone & immature enough to think that a little ""I love you"" will make everything better. They don't understand that, if a man really loves a woman, he doesn't intentionally hurt her...whether physically or emotionally.\n\nGood luck & keep trying! You'll find a good guy. I know they aren't all taken :)"

And it is starting to cause porblems what do I do? Mothers don't stop being mothers just because their daughters grow up and get married. They just aren't wired that way. It might help to talk with your mom about how you and your husband feel when she shows annoyance. Do this when things are calm, not in the heat of the moment. It might also help for you and your husband to talk about how you can enjoy each other and your relationship more privately so that your mom is not exposed to your husband's playfulness.\n\nYou might also just have to learn to live with it and not let it get to you. You can probably figure out a response to your mom that doesn't escalate the stress level. Let her know that you're glad she cares about how you are treated, but that you are comfortable with the way your relationship with your husband works."

You didn't say what the penalty was for (late filing, late payment, interest, trust fund penalties, etc.). Nor did you state who is handling your dispute (IRS Appeals, Collection Due Process, Tax Court). There's slightly different rules depending on what's going on.\n\nThe basic process for handling penalties and disputes is outlined on the IRS website.\n\nIn general, the IRS will investigate whether you are responsible for the penalty, and will send up a notice informing you that the penalty was waived or that you really do owe the penalty. Interest will accrue if you really do owe the penalty, but you haven't paid it yet.\n\nGenerally, I advise my clients to pay all penalties in full, and then dispute the penalties. This shows a good faith effort, and stops additional penalties and interest from being added to the account. If we lose the dispute, at least the client paid only the penalty and not additional interest. If we win, the client gets his money back.\n\nI hope this helps. Let us know how your dispute with the IRS turns out.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nWilliam"

7,"what are the best ways to restore credit? bad credit score First: the ads that say ""we'll fix your credit!"" are LYING. You are the one who's going to have to do the job.\n\nFirst: get your credit report. Most states now have a law on the books that requires all of the credit reporting agencies to give you a credit report once a year. Check it over. Make sure that there are no *mistakes* on it - late payments that were not late, disputed accounts, etc. \n\nLate payments and charged-off accounts stay on for 7 years, bankruptcies for 10. Generally, lenders are looking for patterns of behavior rather than once-in-a-way problems. If you find something wrong (and it's likely, unfortunately), write a letter to the credit bureau, providing documentation that you're right. They have to respond in 30 days; if the creditor can't prove that the negative item is indeed true, it comes off your report.\n\nNow you're down to real debt. If you can't afford the payments, contact the lenders and negotiate reduced payments. They will prefer to be getting something rather than having to write off the debt. Once you can afford to pay everything, commit to paying off the worst (i.e., highest-interest) items first. They cost you the most money that isn't going toward paying off the debt. Once you've killed one, the money you were spending on that one can be applied to the next-worst debt, and so on. The amount you can pay any given creditor snowballs rapidly when you follow this pattern. You have to remember, though, that when the first one is paid off, you don't have ""more money"". You still need to be committing that to killing your debt.\n\nIf you're out of debt, but your credit is lousy, get a secured card, use it, and pay it off every month. This will do a lot for your credit rating. In addition, open a savings account, and make regular deposits. This shows you are saving money and have a resource to pay your bills."

But the government had many statues of women with breasts exposed?  What is the big deal? Your point is very logical. \n\nHowever, also keep in mind that television broadcast decency standards are fairly well-defined. \n\nEvery once in a while, the FCC decides it needs to enforce their powers by the means of a sanction or fines. Otherwise, if the FCC never enforced any rules, their granted powers would diminish over time until people believed the FCC lacked power. Since every government agency tries to keep as much power as possible there is probably political or institutional pressure for the FCC to enforce communications rules. This may not always result in equitable enforcement."

Its the best in terms of researching information.\n\nFor makin money, a #1 on google is worth many times more than a #1 on yahoo. Yahoo! blocks the top of the SERPs with sponsored ads.\n\nGoogle also has a neat interface. Yahoo is not bad too, but its interface is not that neat. The reason for that being it to be a portal. I think a nice interface is very important since people will come back more often if so.\n\nThe relevance of search results make its 'Feeling Lucky' feature pretty useful. Firefox address bar by defaults goes to 1 site listed on your search results.\n\nGoogle has tried to stay away from Spam/ misleading sites better than other search engines.\n\nCons of Google:\n\nHowever, few problems with google, its web crawler dosen't capture hyperlinks from PDF files stored on net, a feature which Yahoo provides.\n\nAlso, Google at present does not provide an index for video aggregation through the web crawler, a feature which Altavista provided since 1999. The problems include accuracy of the media file. That is the reason for providing Google Videos where users have to submit videos.\n\nDue to a larger share of 'searching' community, Google has been targeted by bloggers by planting Google Bombs. Because most bloggers mention the word failure with President Bush's name, the #1 site on searching Failure is the website of President Bush.\n\nYahoo is doing pretty good research in Search Technologies, for example Grokker.\n\nhttp://www.grokker.com/grokker.html?query=Anirudh%20Koul&Yahoo=true&Daypop=true&numResults=250"

Before we moved in together we had only argued a couple of times.  Now we probably argue once a week.  For me I know it’s common to argue, but today I suppose was different.  I just had bought dinner for us and we came back home to a mess.  I began cleaning up the house and after 30 minutes I asker her to help.  A huge fight ensued because she was slamming things around and I had asked her to stop.  I told her that it is okay for her to be upset with me, but to please not take it out on the dishes.  She got angry and said that she can’t stand these arguments and that she was just over everything.  She then stormed off to her bedroom and that’s that.  Is my relationship coming to and end? Something seems to be missing in your story--or your girlfriend is schizoid.  But seriously, it isn't really normal to fight every week, so possibly she is still angry about whatever it is you guys have been fighting about.  I would think about the tone you may have had when you asked her to clean, I imagine you were upset because she wasn't helping, and that may have set her off.  If you want to save your relationship talk to her like an adult to an adult and try to figure out how to resolve your problems in a positive way.  Try to avoid accusatory and patronizing statements.  You two are probably just having trouble adjusting to living together.  Good Luck"

That might depend on wether the binary stars are very close (and spinning about each other) such that they ""look"" almost like a simple center of gravity relative to a planet far enough away to not be affected by lets say bumps in the gravity field.  Einstein told us that gravity distorts space and planets therefore merely follow the curved space layed out for them.  The earth senses the gravitational pull of both the sun  and say Jupiter but only the sun has a major affect because of proximity and mass.  The short answer to your question is that planets can exist in stable (though irregular) orbits around binary stars depending on the curvature of space in its orbit.  Hope that helps a little."

First of all Hindi is not our (India's) single national language. There exists no such thing in our constitution. Languages in our constitution is devided into two categories. Namely Official languages (Central administrative)& Scheduled list of languages for official use.\n\nOfficial languages are Hindi and English\n\nAnother 22 regional languages for official use.\n\nOnly around 40% of Indians speak Hindi as mother tounge but nearly 70% can understand Hindi. And that's hardly a criteria for ""Naional Language""."

The first week of the new year is the ""golden period"".  Several opportunities to make it right.  And if you fuck up, it's over.  You'll feel like a major turd no matter what you do.  If you're lucky, whatever you wanted to do will last for a maximum of two days.  After that?  Screw it. My resolution, like it has been every year since I was thirteen (7 or 8 years ago)is to find a girl who likes me the way I am, is interesting, pretty, and who I can deeply trust and care about. Someone who isn't a snob or some cutey-pie flirt."

5,"Can the cd-rw drive in my laptop play dvd's? Do I have to buy new hardware, or is there a software fix? DVD is a different format with respect to CD RW. If your hardware supports only CDs for reading and burning, then there's no possibility of it reading the DVD. As you mentioned that you have a laptop, I guess it should be a DVD combo, i.e. DVD read only and CD Read/Write support, because that is the standard in laptops. I rarely have known a laptop model which has a CDRW drive, excepting if it is older than 2 years. You can check the DVD logo on the side of your drive. \n\nIn case it is a cdrw and you need to play a dvd, you need a computer with dvd drive on your network neibourhood. Just share the DVD drive on that computer, and you can access the DVD drive as your own drive. Best of luck on the experiment."

2,"Could inteligent life have evolved from a different animal group, such as reptiles, birds or even insects? Does higher intelligence (such as humans have) require some quality that only mammals have? The fact that female mammals produce milk for their young means that at birth a mammal can have a relatively large brain, although they are relatively helpless.  Other animals have to be able to at least get around.\n\nBrains don't grow as much as other parts of the body, which is why babies seem to have large heads.\n\nThe obvious counter-example is birds, where the young are stuck in the nest and depend on their parents for food.  However, flight puts a limit on how heavy a bird can be, and so how heavy its brain can be.  But flightless birds are a possible candidate.\n\nAmphibians and reptiles are cold-blooded, which seems as though it would rule out our sort of intelligence.  On the other hand, perhaps an intelligent crocodile would think of slowing down when the temperature drops much as we think of sleep.  Remember that a large brain would mean a large egg (and you have to fit the rest of the body inside the egg as well)."

His new album, ""Mr. A-Z,"" is excellent and he definitely avoided the sophomore slump. I also love his first album, ""Waiting for my Rocket to Come."" Big Mraz fan... there's also other cds that can be bought if you check out his online store, which is in the source(s) list, but they took off ""Jason Mraz Live"", a CD I bought a couple months back, one of his early recordings. \n\nI love that album - doesn't feel commercial, its a live performance without the screaming fans that you'll find in his ""Tonight Not Again"" album (not that I particularly minded that - great songs on it), and I absolutely love the ""Rand MacNally"" track which, my guess is, the precursor to his hit ""The Remedy"".\n\nYou can also find Mraz singing ""Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy"" on the new Queen tribute album. ""Killer Queen"" I believe its called.\n\nLooking forward to his next album!"

The book which coined the expression was originally titled:\n\n""The Women are from Venus, the Men are from Uranus""\n\nBut then again, they thought it might be subject to some juvenile pranks. So they switched to Mars. Which is closer to earth, but not as close to the point as Uranus."

The Eagles need to find a consistent WR in the draft. Perhaps Sinorice Moss, the younger brother of Santana Moss would help. Their defense also needs some help. I don't know what happened to them, but next year they shouldn't be all that bad. As for McNabb, I'm sick of all this pressure being thrown on him by both Owens and the media. As long as he stays healthy, the Eagles could be a threat--provided Andy Reid keeps the offense balanced. As for Owens, good luck finding a new team."

I want to include some instructions on how to safely crack them open while creating as few pieces as possible. They will vary in size from 3 - 5"" across. One way to open a geode -- to reveal the crystals -- is with a chisel and hammer. Score the geode completely around the outside where you want it to crack -- usually in two equal halves. Keep going until it cracks and breaks apart. This will almost always work and won't damage the crystals."

That's assuming the main drive is labled C.  This also only works for a Windows computer.  What you failed to mention is how she will access information that has been set to be shared.  First off, you want to set a password when your sharing a folder or drive.  You should see a prompt when your setting share settings.  To access a computer that has a shared drive, simply go to network neighborhood, find the computer by clicking on it, and you should be prompted to enter the password you earlier gave, then you have access to the files, you can drag/drop and even save files to other computers."

You want to get a job that pays good and one that advancement is in. It is all about time in and money. When the recuritor tells you you will be getting your Medical ""Free"" that used to make me laugh, because it comes out of your taxes you are paying for it. Not the president. No there is no money transpired, but you are still paying for it. If you want to go into the service, go to college first, go in as an officer not a civilian. Money money money.  That is what you want to get. Your rate and rank has to go up.You will always be tested to achive a better rate. Now, it is a big commetment.  You are going to get married to the service.  There is no way out until your tour is up and then they ask you if you want to stay in.  Will you be educated enough from the military to go out into the world and get a good paying job?  Suppose you fall in love and get married, you cannot live on base unless you are a certain rate. Base living is very nice, but you are not making a lot of money. So now you have to live off base.  Rent is high. So no marriage until your first tour is up get your education and your money.  Better still, go to college before you go into any branch of the service. \nPlease go to college first."

9,"What are good sound reasons for getting a divorce? My father told me to set what would make me divorce my husband and just deal with whatever did not fall in those reasons. Watch for the red flags prior to marriage.  But when in love, we often miss the red flags, so if that happens, here are what I consider serious and justifiable grounds:\n\nAdultery -- many people can't move past this.  It's a physical betrayal, but also tears at you emotionally.  I personally think it's one of the most difficult ones to resolve.\n\nAbuse -- physical or verbal.  Verbal often gets overlooked, but it's namecalling, screaming at you rather than holding a normal conversation, talked down to, and did I mention yelling and screaming?  If you ask the person a normal question, like ""do you have any change for the toll?"" and they start screaming that ""all you do is harp about money,"" you've got a problem.  Physical is obvious, but don't overlook punching walls, breaking dishes, etc.  Watch out for signs of roughness or  meanness to your children and pets too.\n\nControl Freaks:  This is also a form of abuse, but these men want to know your every move, monitor your phone calls, read your email and voice mails, won't let you go to the mall alone, etc.  Insist that if you get a new hairdo or buy a new dress, it must be because you're cheating with someone.  This is usually disguised as jealousy which women may think lattering -- at first.  Don't be fooled.  Control freaks also don't want you to hold a job or have any money of your own.  You must beg for an ""allowance.""\n\nFinancial:  There are a lot of men who live off women.  They have jobs when you meet them.  Then, something happens, and it's always the company or bosses fault.  They tell you they're out job hunting, but nothing is happening.  Next comes laying around on the couch all day, sleeping, watching tv or guzzling beer.  Weeks turn into months and it's just you working.  Or, the person flits from job to job and can't hold a job.  This man will plunge you right into financial ruin and guess what -- you can't get them out of the house all that easy, if it happens to be your house and not a joint home.  Keep an eye out that they don't dip into your wallet.  A dollar or two missing, here and there, usually becomes much more.  You'll get behind on bills, your credit will suffer.  Don't stand for this.\n\nAddictive behavior:  Drugs, alchoholism, gambling.  Will cause you nothing but stress, pain and financial hardship.  Don't try to be the hero and ""help"" the person out of despair.  Unless you are rich enough to get them into very good rehab, like the movie stars do, it probably won't work.  Addicts can only be helped if they want to be and you'll be surprised how many enjoy the behavior and have no desire to give it up.  I've seen men go to AA or a counseling session, come right out and stop at a bar.  It is almost a joke with them.  You may keep gamblers out of casinos, but they'll spend a whole paycheck on lottery tickets or the football pool.\n\nIllegal behavior:  Selling drugs, stealing, pulls insurance scams, (or any scams), etc., RUN.  He'll eventually get caught and you might get implicated too!  Do you want his record to become yours?\n\nGood luck."

We are more roommates now. Here's a hint:  Men like women to show initiative with romance and eroticsm--too often in relationships it's considered the ""man's job"" to get things moving! This will sound corny, but give it a shot:  First, if you've got kids, send them to the grandparents for the night in advance without him knowing (say on a Friday).  Next, turn off all the lights in the house and place scented candles in the bedroom and run a hot bubble bath just before he normally arives home.  Have some wine and two wine glasses at the ready on the coffee table, and rose petals on the floor leading a trail to the bedroom--or whereever you're most memorable encounter that you can remember occurred.  Personally, I like David Sanborn or some other smooth jazz playing in the background. Music is important to setting the mood, and if you've got cable or a dish, you can tune it to the music of your choice. Just before he gets home, slip into a nice satin & lace nightie and cover it with a heavy robe.  When he gets to the door, be there waiting to flash him and let him know what you've got in store for the evening.  Not in a crude way, mind you.  Most importantly, take your time...don't rush.  The anticipation of that which is to come will be as intense as the act itself.  Hope that helps!\nPeace,\nJayZ"

As long as each person asks like themselves and is not trying to put on an act to ipress the other person it can be great.  Seeing that each one of you accept one another for who you are. \n  On the other side if you feel like you have to be soembody you are not simply to get the other person to like you then the relationship is doomed to fail, because you will eventually get tired of not being yourself.  The relationship will be horrible.\n  Being in a relationship can be the greatest thing ever. All you have to do is comunicate and be yourself and you will be happy"

It may also reflect the importance of visitation to the grave, with the stone indicating that someone has been to visit.\n\nRabbi David Wolpe suggests that in ancient times, a shepard counted his sheep at the beginning of the day by carrying the corresponding number of stones, and these were used to ascertain that the same number returned at night. Rabbi Wolpe then suggests that thestones may symbolize how precious each soul is to God, who, as it were, 'counts"" each person in the world.\n\n-->"

1,why does a human live for only abt 70 odd years..........? who was longets living human on record..? People have a genetic coding that basically extends life to approx 125 years old.  Our genetic make up accounts for approximately 30% of our life expectancy.  Environment and habits accounts for the other 70%.  Our bodies are constantly breaking down and our body does not have the ability to repair these breakdown indefinately.  Once our body loses the ability to repair our breakdowns we begin to see signs of aging.  Once the process begins we are unable to effectively stop it.  Maybe with advances of science and gene therapy we can extend our ability to repair but until then you are kind of stuck with your genetic make up.

What do they expect from us me.  I'm a nice guy, but what more do you want from us? Girls do like nice guys. I had a bad boy phase myself, but after I got sick of their games and lies, a nice guy was the one who won my heart afterall. Sometimes it is hard for a girl to see that a guy they are dating isn't nice at first. Alot of jerks act super nice to get into bed with them, and even abusers have been known to act really sweet to the girl to gain their trust and then ruin their self confidence bit by bit, but the whole time, the girl may not see it, they see the ""nice"" guy they fell in love with. They sometimes never realize it was an act all along. Outsiders realize that this guy is a jerk, but the girl is so naive, they think that he really is nice, deep down. Some girls also feel they do not deserve someone nice. I felt this way for awhile after a mentally abusive relationship. I thought noone decent would love me. But I was wrong, and the girls who only date jerks are too. Just hard to make them see it. Find a girl who is ready for a nice guy, they are out there, justhard to find nowadays ;)"

2,"According to news sites, the Earth's rotation slows only 2 milliseconds each 100 years. So why the heck are ...so why the heck have we added like over 21 leap seconds in the past 30 years???!!!!    Something is not right.  If the Earth only slows 2 milliseconds each hundred years, why not just add 2 milliseconds to the clock each century?!!! nothing to do with daylight savings. Daylight savings is a human invention, not a natural phenomenon.\n\n...because leap seconds are not being added to compensate for the Earth's rotation slowing down.\n\nThe amount of time it takes for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365.2425 days.\n\nEven that is an approximation, the decimal digits can keep going on.\n\nSo initially, the calendar was divided evenly in 365 days. But about every 4 years, you'd be off 1 day. A century later, you've drifted off by a whole month!\n\nSo, leap years came into effect. Febuary has another day every 4 years. \n\nBut now you've approximated a year to 365.25 days, when in reality, its 365.2425 days.\n\nEvery century, you'll be off 1 day.\n\nSo that's where the next rule comes into play: ""If the year is divisible by 4, but not by 100, its a leap year.""\n\nNow we've approximated it to 365.2425, but because its always going to be an approximation, our calendar days are always slipping. All because the earth doesn't take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.\n\nThis is why leap seconds are added, and not to account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation.\n\nAs to why days are divided in exactly 24 hours, I'm not sure. But I would think the time difference is WAY less than 20 minutes, or we'd notice that soon enough, its dark at noon! :)  Time was divided a long time ago, and a simple system was sought for keeping track of it, so the minuts/hour/year thing is a nice division thats easy to do math with. The lost time, if its accounted for by leap years and such, could be easier to manage.\n\nFirst, I never said the earth is not slowing down. I said its not why leap seconds exist. And ok, I can entertain my explanation may be wrong, but that's no reason for your condescending tone, Jolly Roger. But look, your link brings me to a christian science evanglism site, where is the evidence that my answer is incorrect? \n\nYou haven't bothered to explain his original question. If leapseconds account for the slowdown of the earth's rotation, why are there leap seconds and not leap milliseconds?\n\nIf you want to append to your answer, at least try to do so while respecting the other users on this site, and not insult their intelligence.\n\nThis has piqued my curiosity, if there's anyone out there that has a source that says my explanation is incorrect, I mean an actual science website, you know, one that steers clear of religion, please let me know."

5,"sbc offers different price rates for dsl.  what is the best if my son will be playing x box live? is there different speeds with different pricing?  with what we have now he's playing people that have cable dsl and he keeps getting booted off Xbox Live is just like any online game. The biggest issue you will ever see has to do with Latency, also known as ""Lag"". \n\nLatency occurs when there are bottlenecks in the general network layout. Think LA freeways at 5pm on a Friday night. Unfortunately this issue is not one you can change, because it has to do with the actual design of the network, so choosing your provider properly is essential.\n\nCable Internet, in its basic form, is a shared medium. This means that every person who subscribes to Cable in your neighborhood shares the same on-ramp to the internet. This is only a problem if there are large numbers of concurrent users in your area.\n\nDSL, on the other hand, connects you to the backbone in a more efficient, seperated manner. This has the advantage of being much less susceptible to latency. Unfortunately, this advantage goes down the farther away from the switching office (CO) you are. \n\nAnother thing to consider is newer Cable networks tend to use a different model of communications than the old ones, and so approach DSL levels of service.\n\nTo sum up: DSL is better than Cable, but tends to be slower. However any speed higher than about 1 meg / sec should be MORE than sufficient to run today's games."

I have had some jobs where I just stayed 2or three months should I put them on my resume I stopped putting those little jobs on mine, and I don't think anyone cares.  (Having a lot there can make the resume hard to read, and bury the important work you've done.)\n\nMostly, employers are concerned with experience that actually relates to the job for which you're submitting the resume.\n\nUsually, if an employer wants a _complete_ job history (for government jobs, background checks, etc), they'll give you a separate form with plenty of legal language concerning the honesty of your answers.\n\nJust make sure you're completely honest about your work history when it comes time to sign forms."

I was told by my dentist that my teeth Wisdom teeth must be removed.  \nAm I in danger of losing my ""wisdom""?  \nShould I allow this dentist to ""de-wisdomize"" me? WISDOM TEETH: IS IT WISE TO REMOVE THEM?\n\nCommon misunderstandings surround their name origin, removal reasons and pain sources\n\nWisdom teeth, also known as third molars, are the last teeth to grow in the back of\nthe mouth. Common misunderstandings surround their name origin, removal reasons and\npain sources, according to the Academy of General Dentistry, an organization of\ngeneral dentists dedicated to continuing education. \n\n""The name 'wisdom teeth' is age related - third molars don't erupt until teenage\nyears and beyond, when people theoretically are more wise to the world,"" says Trey\nPetty, DDS, FAGD, spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry.\n\nCommon reasons for wisdom teeth removal include impaction, pain and crowding of the\nother teeth, which are typical tooth growth characteristics.\n\n""If wisdom teeth are not visible, they are impacted or unable to erupt due to space\nand size limitations,"" says Dr. Petty. ""Impacted teeth don't have enough room to grow,\nand will lay beneath the gums, which may or may not be a problem."" \n\nPain and tooth crowding are also top wisdom teeth problems. ""Adults have forgotten\nwhat normal pain from a growing tooth feels like,"" says Dr. Petty. Complications also\ncan arise when wisdom teeth partially erupt. The broken gum acts as a breeding ground\nfor bacteria and germs. \n\n""When wisdom teeth partially erupt, food gets caught in the gums and may cause an\ninfection, swelling, growth of a tumor or cyst and pain,"" says Dr. Petty. ""If this\nhappens, consult a dentist before problems worsen and affect overall oral health.""\n\n""If wisdom teeth have erupted, the key to preserving them is maintaining good oral\nhealth by brushing twice a day and going to see a dentist twice a year,"" says\nDr. Petty."

THIS IS MY OPINION, NOT LEGAL ADVICE!!!!\n\nForeign nationals from poor countries are often denied visas under 214(b), intending immigrant.  Unlike in other areas of the law, applicants are considered guilty until proven innocent.\n\nYou must convice the visa officer that your life in Georgia is better than a potential life in America.  This is accomplished by showing close ties to your home country.\n\nYou should present evidence of the following things at your visa interview:\n1)  A letter from your employer indicating that you have a good job and are expected to return to your job after you return.\n2)  A copy of your bank statements showing that you have sufficient money to fund your trip.\n3)  A copy of your lease/mortgage showing that you have a home in Georgia that you can not leave.\n4)  Proof of a car.\n5)  Photos of you travelling in other developed countries.  For example, if you went to London on vacation and came back, you are more likely to return to Georgia after visiting New York.\n6)   A good reason to visit America.  I would say that you want to go to Las Vegas and Los Angeles.  Don't say: I want to stay at my cousin's house for three months.\n7) Luck.  Honestly, if your cousin lives in Chicago and the visa officer is from Chicago, you will have better luck.  I once went to a lecture by a visa officer.  He said that he once approved somebody because an applicant was planning on studying in America, but wanted to look at colleges first.  One of the five colleges listed, was the speakers small liberal arts college.  Because of that, the visa was granted."

Do they make each other stronger or take away? This is more of a case-by-case situation. With the understanding that both people are very passionate, the whole relationship could boil down to a competition of expression; one might try to outdue the other in showing how much they care. Depending on the people, this could come out very well, but at the same time, it could end in catastrophe. Another way it could end up going is that one of the two may feel too clouded in the other's show of passion, and feel like they need a break... thus possibly bringing the whole thing to an end. Not a common occurance, but it happens. The last thing i will mention is the more common of the 3, and by far, the best. The two people keep their display of passion limited to a certain amount. this assures that noone will feel drown out, and at the same time, neither of the two feels neglected by the other. I'm not talking about only saying ""i love you"" every 3rd wednesday or anything, those little things are ok to do whenever, but bigger things like dinner dates, trips to the movies, roses and yes, even sex, should be ""rationed"" to make sure you don't burn your candle down too fast and feel that there is nothing more really for you. \n\nIt is possible for any of these to happen, and with some variance, but once again, it all boils down to the types of people involved. Their other traits in their personality and their past will influence which path will occur.\n\n(i love your questions btw, give me more to answer, lol)"

Sublimed and washed sulfur are in the form of a fine yellow crystalline powder, with only a faint odor and taste. Precipitated sulfur is a very fine pale yellow amorphous or microcryst powder, which is odorless and tasteless. I am still looking for toxicity data and I will update my answer if I find anything. I wouldn't worry about using it, the cure is probably better than the illness. But always talk to a doctor before starting any kind of treatments."

When displayed, they provide an animated sequence that cycles over and over without stopping. Although popular on the Web, animated GIFs are larger than single-frame GIFs and take longer to download. Typically used for ad banners, the animation is usually confined to small areas of the image to keep the file size short. Very different than GIF and much more sophisticated, Flash is popular on the Web for instructional sequences as well as animations of all kind. Flash is an interactive format and its vector images take up much less space than GIF's bitmapped images. See Flash and GIF"

Once you know what type of people you'll be dealing with you'll be more at ease knowing you can handle what difficulties may come from them.

The four things we can taste (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) don't change. However, our sensitivity to each of the four can change as we age and our sensitivity to smells (which is an important component of taste) can also change. Finally, our preferences can change so that things we once found ""tasty"" no longer appeal to us and vice-versa."

Often you can use an internet search engine to help sort out what is best to leave.  Make sure that you delete any games.

Delete every thing that you can, including the stuff in the Trash can.\n\nNext open My Computer and highlight and select your hard drive with a single right click.

The highly complex economy we have today is mainly the result of these natural developments. Governmental interference can only make a limited amount of difference."

Can anybody tell me the procedures for a full, 100% consciousness out of body experience through the help of sleep or meditation? I've read a ton of books on the subject, that was quite a few years ago so I don't know what to recommend.  I had quite an experience that has stayed with me ever since that's too long to talk about here, but it was convincing enough, and I'm not prone to falling for supernatural explanations to explain what I don't understand.\n\nIn a nutshell, you need to be very relaxed and not in a place you can be distracted.  A breathing excercise helps, I use the ""breath in to count of three, hold for four, breath out for 5"" routine.  Get as relaxed as possible and concentrate on raising yourself up out of your body.  If you can concentrate easily it takes less tries of course, but you will actually feel it happen.  Whether that's a dream or not I don't know.  When you get to that point pick a place in the house to go to and concentrate on going there.  It's really simple, and doesn't take a great deal of effort.  This is the stage I was able to achieve, around 1986, when I stopped and never did it again.  Nothing really scary, I guess it just convinced me enough and I left it at that.\n\nGood luck."

Will I get in trouble with the law by admitting that I gamble online (as millions of others do.) I agree with the answers provided above, but with one caveat. Illegal business activities are not allowed to deduct business expenses. So reporting the illegal gambling winnings on a Schedule C would mean that no expenses can be claimed. This would subject the gross winnings (from illegal gambling) to Self-Employment Taxes. This will increase your taxes, and not provide you with the benefit of deductible expenses.\n\nSo, I would list this income as gambling winnings, with losses reported on Schedule A as an itemized deduction.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nWilliam"

My mom almost died from it, which is unheard of, and she ended up having a foot of intestine being taken out. Watch out! It can get pretty damn serious."

Get a full upper scope (EGD) and a colonoscopy done.  Get some lab tests to measured inflammation (ESR, CRP) and most of all speak to your doctor.  Sounds like you could have Crohn's disease, but you could also just have irritable bowel syndrome with some ulcers mixed in for the nausea.  Lastly you could have peptic ulcer disease which can be easily treated with antibiotics.  Just get tested and talk to your doctor... and DEMAND answers! :)"

10,"What are the essential elements of a rule of law in the United States? One purpose if the limitations impoosed by the american constitutional government is to check the power of the majority. How can this be justified in a political system that is based on popular sovereignty? The justification for checking the majority rests in the fact that the majority can not use their power to control a minority. The saying majority rules/minority rights is a good example. The majority is in charge but they can not use their power to stomp out a minority or take away minority rights. Also, the fouding fathers wanted to include this so that a dictatorship/kingship couldn't take form. By limiting the majority it limits their ability to take control in such a way."

5,"DSL vs. broadband? What is the difference? Is there a difference? DSL is a type of broadband connection.  It stands for Digital Subscriber Line, and is offered by traditional phone companies (wired, not wireless).  The signal travels thru phone lines and into your home or business.  A modem is connected to it so it can translate the signal into ditigal data and then is usually output via Ethernet.  Its main competitor (at least in homes)is Cable broadband.  The difference between the two is that cable generally provides faster bandwith (download/upload speed), but is less secure than DSL, which provides each user with a unique IP (Internet Protocol)address.  Most cable internet home subscribers are connected to a router with up to 255 other subscribers, making attacks and intrusions much more likely."

Mozilla Firefox is a free, cross-platform, graphical web browser developed by the Mozilla Corporation and hundreds of volunteers.[1] The browser began as a fork of the Navigator component of the Mozilla Application Suite; Firefox has since become the foundation's main development focus (along with its Thunderbird mail and news client), and has replaced the Mozilla Suite as their official main software release.\n\nBefore its 1.0 release, Firefox had already gained acclaim from numerous media outlets, including Forbes[2] and the Wall Street Journal.[3] With over 25 million downloads in the 99 days after the initial 1.0 release, Firefox became one of the most downloaded free and open source applications, especially among home users.[4] On October 19, 2005, Firefox had its 100 millionth download, just 344 days after the release of version 1.0.[5] Firefox 1.5 was released on November 29, 2005, on the redesigned Mozilla Corporation website, with more than 2 million downloads within the first 36 hours.\n\nFirefox includes an integrated pop-up blocker, tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, support for open standards, and an extension mechanism for adding functionality. Although other browsers have introduced these features, Firefox became the first such browser to achieve wide adoption.\n\nFirefox has attracted attention as an alternative to other browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. As of November 2005, estimates suggest that Firefox's usage share is around 9.4% of overall browser usage (See market adoption), with its highest usage in Finland (about 30%). Since its release, Firefox has contributed to a reduction in Internet Explorer's dominant usage share.\n\nYou can download it at:\n\nhttp://www.mozilla.com/firefox/"

4,"Instead of exluding discussions of evolution/creationism/Intelligent Design, why not teach all 3? Why exclude? Let people make up their own minds. Seems to me if you leave one or two out, it 'authorizes' one view over any other. There's no reason that all three shouldn't be taught.  However, creationism and intelligent design should certainly not be taught in a science class because they're not scientific at all.  It's not a question of ""making up minds,"" it's a question of science class.\n\nItelligent design and creationism should and could be taught by parents or at Sunday school or during a religious studies class at school.  They're not science, but there's nothing wrong with that.  The fact that they're not science does NOT mean that they aren't true."

2,"Natural gas composition? There was a gas leak in the building at work today.  The plumber, gas company, and other people said that the gas is denser than the air, so it sinks.  I accept that fact, I know there are dangers of using propane heaters in a duck boat because the gas can settle in the bottom of the boat.\n\nBut when I was in 8th grade, we did a science experiment.  We filled up drycleaning bags with the natural gas that comes from the spigots of each lab table (for the bunsen burners).  Then we put in a SASE in each bag, taped them shut, and released them outside.  All the bags floated off.  They were made of transparent plastic.  That implies the gas is lighter than air.\n\nSo why are there warning about the natural gas settling in a basement or other low areas?  I natural gas composed of methane, ethane, propane, butane, etc but in diminishing percentages?

5,"How to be among the first results on a search engine? I heard it helps to have the right keywords on the head of the html code as ""meta names""... anyone can help me further? Allow me to answer this question because I AM on the top #1 spot in three different categories (first names, nursery rhymes, blonde jokes).\n\nCONTENT -- \nFirst and foremost, the content you have on your site is the most important and most crucial thing over anyting else that you can do to your site. What I advise my clients to do is to actually THINK like a search engine or if that is too abstract, think like someone who speaks a different language. \n\nAlthough search engines are getting much better at figuring out exactly what it is that is on the page, remember it is often impossible for them to decipher Java, Javascript, Flash, and other non-HTML components. This is NOT to say don't use them, just use them when they are to be used appropriately.\n\nBecause search engines ARE getting better at figuring out what is on a page, spelling and grammar are also very important. The rule of thumb is no more than three misspellings and no more than three gramatical errors on a page. Sentences should be of short to medium length and paragraphs should also be rather short.\n\nDO NOT COPY OTHER PEOPLE'S WORK. The search engines can penalize a site heavily for plagiarism.\n\nTAGS\n\nTitle Tags -- The most important of all tags is the Title tag. This is what shows up on the bars on the bottom of your computer screen. Most people make the mistake of putting their company name in the Title Tag and that is the worst thing to do (other than putting no tag at all). A Title Tag should be short and to the point and tell what the page is about and if you want to add your company name then add it at the END of the title tag not at the beginning.\n\nMeta Tags -- Meta tags were how search engines would know what was on a page... many years ago. However, with that said it is important that Meta tags are still added to your site and more importantly there are new meta tags (more than just description and keywords) that should be added to the web site such as content type and content language.\n\nMeta Description -- Meta description should start out with the SAME thing your TITLE tag says and then go into more detail. \n\nMeta Keywords -- Meta keywords are words used to describe what is in your page. First use keywords that are in the title and the description first. Then use keywords that are in the content of the page. DO NOT try to spam the search engines by using keywords that are not relevant to your content.\n\nAlt Tags -- With the advent of XHTML, ALT tags for images are now REQUIRED. The Alt tag is used for people who have their images turned off so it is important to have in the alt tag exactly what the image is but also expand on what it is. An example would be a HOME button. Instead of just having HOME as the Alt Tag, use Home -- Site Name.com. \n\nI have noticed that search engines love geography and it is good to put that in there whenever appropriate. If your company is in Kansas City, MO then put those in the Content and in the Tags.\n\nLINKS\n\nHaving links that send people to sites relevant to your site is always a good practice. People ask me where I get links and how do I get people to link to my site. The answer is very simple. First I ask. I write e-mails (NOT SPAM) to sites asking if they wish to reciprocate links with me and I also have on some of my pages a ""Link to this Page"" button so that web site owners can do it on their own.\n\nThere is great debate as to whether links to other sites that are not of the same category help, hurt, or are indifferent. From my ten years experience I have found that appropriate links DO NOT hurt your web site and could very well help in some instances.\n\nPRIVACY POLICY\n\nI won't go into much detail here but make sure you have one. So many people forget this and it is extremely important. You will NOT find a major web page that does not have a Privacy Policy attached to it.\n\nTRAFFIC\n\nObviously the more traffic you have coming to your web site the better. Not only ar"

Uranus obeys the Titius-Bode rule, it is Neptune which doesn't.\n\nNo hard explanation, only an analogy: in quantum mechanics, the outer orbits of electrons may approach a continuum, as they do in metal bonds. With the increasing distances in the logarithmic Titius-Bode sequence, probably the quadratic distance influence of gravity allow intermediary orbits."

Legally, you can get a lawyer and pursue the status of an emancipated minor, but that takes money and time.  Odds are at 17 you haven't got the money, and by the time it was over you'd be 18 and free anyway.  \n\nNow, if there is actual abuse going on, get in touch with a local child abuse advocacy group or file a complaint with local law enforcement."

When getting upset is not accomplishing anything and interfering with your ability to function, that's too many times.\n\nYou are probably getting upset because you don't feel like you have the power to change your situation.  This will lead to depression.\n\nThe best way to save money is to put a few dollars in a savings account every time you get your check.  If you have direct deposit, talk to your bank to find out if they can do this automatically.  Another practical solution is to make a diary of what, when and how you are spending your money so that you can see where your weaknesses are.  However, overspending can happen because it makes you feel better or in control, so this may be a symptom of depression.\n\nWhen you are depressed, it's hard to feel like people will be interested in you or even like you.  This creates a barrier between you and other people.\n\nTherapy would be your best way to handle this - a therapist could guide you in making changes that will improve your life.  If you can't afford or get access to a therapist, the next best thing is a book called ""Feeling Good: the New Mood Therapy"" by David D. Burns"

2,"Why do people need sleep? We've always accepted it as a fact of life, but why didn't humans evolve to have excellent night vision (like cats) and be less efficient with food (burn more calories INSTEAD of sleeping)? Wouldn't this have worked just as well? Nobody knows for sure; however, there are many theories.  Below is a very plasable one:\n\nJerome Siegel, of the University of California in Los Angeles, along with colleagues elsewhere, has suggested a third possibility. Writing in a special review of sleep in the current issue of Nature, Dr Siegel says that it may be related to defence against oxidative stress. Smaller animals have higher metabolic rates, and this results in the generation of higher levels of small, highly reactive molecules such as free radicals. Studies on rats show that when they are deprived of sleep, their oxidative stress increases. Dr Siegel proposes that animals with higher metabolic rates need more sleep to interrupt and protect against this kind of oxidative damage, as well as repairing any damage done."
7,"Virtual Administrative Assistant/Answering Service? Has anyone worked with a Virtual Assistant? Would you pay for the service? I am thinking of starting this serv\nA Virtual Admin. I am thinking of starting a small business as an virtual admin. asst. setting up  video-conferences for different companies using my software and camera. As well as projects that any Admin. Asst. would do. I have worked with Polycom, and Breeze Presenter/PowerPoint. Does anyone think they would have a use for this. My rates would go around 25-50 an hr depending on the type of services your looking for.\nVideo conferences would be a bit more just because of the cost I would have to eat. Let me know what anyone thinks. Starting as a virtual assistant is a great idea. (I know, I started that way several years ago.) I do recommend that any of those new to the industry consider your best areas of service before launching and specialize from the start.\n\nUnless you are planning on doing the video conferencing locally, I think you may find that to be a bit difficult to pull off. Not because it can't be done, but because you would need to work with clients that are able to set up the hardware and software on their own sites. Usually, people hire you to solve problems -- and the video conferencing has a serious potential to CREATE problems, especially long distance.\n\nBefore you launch a VA practice, research the name you plan to use for the business (an Internet search is a great place to begin) because you don't want to use a name that's already in use (and possibly trademark protected).\n\nThen consider your strengths and weaknesses. Do an honest self-assessment to determine what services you can offer that will benefit your clients while emphasising your skills, background and education without requiring you to delve into areas that are not your best.\n\nIf you are going to be a VA, a website is essential. If creating a good website isn't your strength -- hire it out or barter services with someone else who can create an effective site.\n\nMarket yourself everywhere you go (business cards at the ready). And, always look for opportunities to talk about what you do -- this is most easily achieved by asking others about their own work (they will usually return the favor). Although Virtual Assistance is a known term in many circles, it still seems to create a bit of interest in casual conversation -- use that to your advantage by begin able to answer questions about the industry in general and your own business in particular.\n\nRead articles by others on the topic of running your own VA business.\n\nBe sure you are willing to put in the hours required to start and run a business. It's not as simple as announcing and starting to work. You will need to research your market, talk with people in the business, talk with people in your target industry/industries, read, research on the web and... PLAN.\n\nBest wishes to you as you begin your endeavor. It's a great career option brought to you by this age of technology!"

Ubuntu and most Linux distros come with bootloaders which will allow you to dual boot OSX and the Linux distro, in this case Ubuntu.  The Ubuntu installer should be able to partition and format your drive while keeping the OSX installation intact.  Once you have installed Ubuntu you should be able to select from either Ubuntu or OSX to boot with.  Ubuntu shouldn't take more than 3GB for the install but you will want to give it at least a 10GB partition to work with.\n\nI know next to nothing about dual booting a Mac but that is how it would work on Windows."

6,"How did they come up with the 5 rings as the symbol for the Olympics? Hint : I was told that the rings DO NOT represent the 5 continents I'm not sure how to interpret your ""hint"", but Wikipedia says:\n\nThe Olympic movement uses many symbols, most of them representing Coubertin's ideas and ideals. The best known symbol is probably that of the Olympic Rings. These five intertwined rings represent the unity of five continents. They appear in five colors on a white field on the Olympic Flag. These colors, white (for the field), red, blue, green, yellow, and black were chosen such that each nation had at least one of these colors in its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914, but the first Games at which it was flown were Antwerp, 1920. It is hoisted at each celebration of the Games.\n\nAre you positive your hinter is reliable? Maybe they meant how the colors (or which there are also five) do not represent the continents?"

All brings back to the very reason for existence, very reason why God created mankind. (N.B. I do believe in God) Did God created man so that he could spend his time leisuring, get drunk, fool around, have intercourse for fun etc?\n\nYou asked for opinion and this is mine: No, God did not create us just for fun without any particular reason. The Supreme ONE must have had a cause for all of us. As for me, I believe that we are all created to 'enslave' ourselves to Him. Life is a test, and only His worthy subjects will be rewarded with heaven in hereafter.\n\nSurely, He must have provided us with a manual for us to navigate ourselves in life i.e. finding the true path to Him. Like we when buy a car, the manufacturer provides us with the manual. So it is up to us to look into the manual, or rather to look FOR the manual in any old 'drawer' that we might have misplaced it.\n\nGood luck. May God bless you."

He lacks the ability to analyze a problem taking into consideration other points of view.

Tennis bracelets, also known as diamond line bracelets, are thin, elegant pieces of wrist jewelry that feature a symmetrical pattern of diamonds. Unlike charm bracelets, they lack pendants or mementos. \nAccording to numerous web sites, such as Professional Jeweler Magazine and Normans of Mosman, tennis star Chris Evert was known for her diamond line bracelets. She lost one during the 1987 U.S. Open, and the game had to be temporarily halted while she prowled the court for it. The ""tennis bracelet"" incident sparked a new name for the item, as well as a huge jewelry trend. \n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the great Chris Evert, last year Serena Williams wore a custom-design Harry Winston tennis bracelet at the U.S. Open.

ETA of the system is a major part, I'm willing to spend up to $8,000 on computer, screen, and accessories.\n\nWould a top-notch Dell XPS desktop be a good buy?\n\nBaring in mind I'm not building or buying part seperately.  I am looking in particular for people who have used the XPS 600 I helped a longtime occasional client with the setup of an XPS 600 within the last month - she'd been on Windows 98 about 2 years longer than she should have been, so it was ripe for her to upgrade.  \n\nPhysically, the machine is pretty imposing - it's slightly taller than the standard Optiplex or Dimension tower, and taller than the minitowers you find in most stores (CompUSA, Best Buy, Circuit City, etc.) but the extra size does provide a lot of space for internal devices, many of which you can have preinstalled and configured by Dell.  It's also pretty wide - wider than her old tower by 2-3 inches.  \n\nBecause my client wanted several measures of reliability and backup, we had the system preconfigured with a mirrored RAID array (2x250GB HDs), a DVD+/-RW drive for ad hoc backups, and an external harddrive for scheduled backups that can backup the entire drive.  Since she also wanted to be able to do graphics editing in the future, we got the machine with a GeForce 6800 graphics card (leaving open the option to add a second card in SLI configuration at a later date, if needed, though if they'd offered the option earlier, I would have recommended the 7800 GTX) and got a good 5.1 sound card installed as well (hooked up to old speakers, but WTF - it's her money) and 2GB RAM, with room to go up to 4GB if needed.\n\nFor external expansion, it comes with 8 USB 2.0 ports, and 3(?) firewire ports.  6 of the USB ports are in the back, with 2 firewire, while 3 are in front, behind a small panel.  We actually used most of the USB ports while setting up most of her peripherals, but you can always add a USB 2.0 high speed hub if you have that many additional devices.    If you have older keyboards and/or mice you're fond of that are PS/2, the machine does have ports for those as well.   (My client is still using a 10-year old keyboard from her old 486 PC that ran Windows 95.  I think it's Dorian Grey's keyboard, and has a printout of itself aging in a closet somewhere.)  If you have an old parallel printer though, it does NOT have a parallel port, so you'll need a parallel to USB cable or you'll need to order a parallel port card.\n\nFrom a software standpoint, the machine is very nice to use - everything runs very smoothly (in part thanks to the dual core CPU) with the only hiccup being AOL, which was preinstalled, but still has problems even in version 9.0 with playing well with Internet Explorer, since AOL uses the IE kernel for its own browsing component - running the two at the same time caused problems.\n\nAll in old, I'd say this is an excellent PC, competitive with other high end PCs from boutique manufacturers.  Where it falls short is the ability to get Dell on the phone - even with ""a separate queue just for XPS users"", we were on hold for close to an hour without ever speaking with a representative when trying to find out whether the shipped PC actually matched the original specs fro when the PC was ordered through the website.  Smaller PC vendors, such as Falcon-Northwest, VoodooPC, Monarch, and ABS are much better about being responsive to customers after the sale than Dell was here.  Aside from that, it's an excellent PC."

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a term used to describe a group of closely related rare heart defects that are present at birth. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is characterized by the underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the chambers on the left side of the heart (i.e., left atrium and ventricle). In addition, the mitral valve, which connects these chambers to each other, is usually abnormally narrow (stenosis) or closed (atresia) and the aortic valve, which connects the heart to the major vessels that lead from the lungs (ascending aorta), may also be narrow or closed. Infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have an abnormally narrow ascending aorta."

Lol....I can't tell you the number of people that ask if I wear shoes, listen to country music or if I ever slept with my cousin. Do we Tennesseans have that bad of a reputation? lol It's not just Tennessee; unfortunately we in Kentucky have a similar, and similarly unjustified, reputation. I think it was a rumor started by Yankee jealous because Southerners can pronounce ""r"" sounds in the middle of words. (ex: New York vs. New Yawk).\n\nBTW, I've been to Nashville, and I saw many shoes of all types there. :)"

7,"why do we hav dream? When i sleep i often hav dream y do we hav dream when sleeping. Everybody dreams though they may not remember them. There are many schools of thought on the dreaming process. It is believed that they are just random images going through your brain, it is also believed that your dreams hold meanings by analyzing the images. \n Personally I love dreaming and when I go through stages of not remembering them it saddens me as I learn alot of things from my dreams.

10,"What is the legal definition of ""war""? It seems that the term ""war"" is being applied to such a range of conflicts.  World War I and World War II were more clear.  But the drug war, war on poverty, war on obesity, and the war on terrorism.  Should not Congress declare war?  And shouldn't the conflict with terrorists be a police action? A state of open, armed, often prolonged conflict carried on between nations, states, or parties. \nThe period of such conflict. \nThe techniques and procedures of war; military science. \nIn an active state of conflict or contention.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[Middle English warre, from Old North French werre, of Germanic origin. See wers- in Indo-European Roots.] \nWord History: The chaos of war is reflected in the semantic history of the word war. War can be traced back to the Indo-European root *wers-, “to confuse, mix up.” In the Germanic family of the Indo-European languages, this root gave rise to several words having to do with confusion or mixture of various kinds. One was the noun *werza-, “confusion,” which in a later form *werra- was borrowed into Old French, probably from Frankish, a largely unrecorded Germanic language that contributed about 200 words to the vocabulary of Old French. From the Germanic stem came both the form werre in Old North French, the form borrowed into English in the 12th century, and guerre (the source of guerrilla) in the rest of the Old French-speaking area. Both forms meant “war.” Meanwhile another form derived from the same Indo-European root had developed into a word denoting a more benign kind of mixture, Old High German wurst, meaning “sausage.” Modern German Wurst was borrowed into English in the 19th century, first by itself (recorded in 1855) and then as part of the word liverwurst (1869), the liver being a translation of German Leber in Leberwurst."

If I will pass ""A/C"" as dept then the report will display the records of only those employees who are working in A/C dept.\n\nThe answer is very necessary please help me. First of all you need to design for the specific criteria.\n\nRemember, the windows API follows message passing architecture and you can handle the text change message by double clicking the textbox or creating one method for your own. Now in each textbox change method, try to find all records that match the criteria for a given field ( the same text string), and display ( you might be able to display only one or also program with a next button ), the current record.\n\nBut catching a textchange message is very performance intense thing to do in programming. You may wanna first enter a value in any text, and when a button is clicked you might wanna check for any nonempty textbox and get required recod and display.\n\nHope it helps."

6,"What year did Wahoo Mcdaniels die? wrestling star April 19th, 2002\n\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- Wahoo McDaniel, the former pro football player who became one of pro wrestling's most flamboyant figures, has died of complications from renal failure and diabetes. He was 63. \n\nMcDaniel, who lost both of his kidneys about 4 1/2 years ago, died Thursday night at Cy-Fair Medical Clinic in Houston, his oldest daughter said. He'd been in failing health in recent years, often undergoing kidney dialysis. McDaniel was on a waiting list to receive a kidney transplant. \n\nHe was born in Bernice, La., on June 19, 1938, and was a schoolboy football star at Midland (Texas) High School in the 1950s. \n\nMcDaniel moved on to the University of Oklahoma, where he lettered at linebacker from 1957-59. He holds the school record for the longest punt with a 91-yarder against Iowa State in 1958. \n\n""He was a wild, crazy Indian,"" daughter Nicky Rowe said Friday. ""He was bigger than life. He was just amazing."" \n\nThe 5-foot-11, 280-pound McDaniel was selected by Los Angeles in the second round of the American Football League draft in 1960. He bounced around the AFL for much of his eight-year career, spending time with the Houston Oilers, Denver Broncos, New York Jets and, finally, the Miami Dolphins. \n\nBy the end of his football career, McDaniel had already established himself as a big name in minor-league wrestling circuits around the country. But as a member of the Jets, McDaniel began to headline wrestling events at Madison Square Garden with the help of the arena's owner, Sonny Werblin. Werblin also was involved in the ownership of the Jets. \n\nMcDaniel capitalized on the stardom from his gridiron days to make a smooth transition into full-time wrestling. He became one of the country's most popular and beloved wrestlers during the '60s, '70s and '80s. \n\n""He was one of the first to make transition from football to wrestling,"" said Bob Ryder, who operates the wrestling Web site, 1wrestling.com. ""When he found out he was making more money as a wrestler than a football player, he gave up football. He was such a big star."" \n\nOver the course of his 30-year wrestling career, McDaniel had memorable battles with wrestling stars such as ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper and Sgt. Slaughter. He won several titles before retiring in 1989. \n\n""I wrestled all the top wrestlers in the world, and I traveled a lot,"" McDaniel said once. ""I got to see a lot of places that I probably wouldn't have gotten to see."" \n\nHe was also fiercely proud of his Chickasaw Indian heritage and always entered the ring with his trademark elaborate feather headdress. \n\nShortly after retiring, health problems limited McDaniel to one of his newfound passions -- golf. He lived in Charlotte, N.C., until recently, but moved to Houston to live with his daughter and son-in-law as his health began to deteriorate. \n\n""He also became a mentor to a lot of other wrestlers,"" Rowe said. ""He was so famous, I just didn't realize it until now. We've got so many calls from people."" \n\nRowe said the family plans to cremate McDaniel's body and scatter the ashes over a lake near Del Rio, which was once the favorite fishing spot for her father and grandfather. They also plan to hold a memorial service for McDaniel in Midland next week. \n\nHe is survived by two daughters and a son."

If it falls down from the top of the cliff to the ground 200 meters below, it'll hit the ground in 6.413696282 seconds if it doesn't strike any object on the way down.  If all it did was to trip and hit the ground still on top of the cliff and took 20 seconds to do so, it probably struggled to remain up (on either 2 or 4 paws) and probably will remain its original color.\n\nHowever, since the bear spent 20 seconds falling a distance that should have taken it < 7 seconds, then it probably fought its way down, bouncing from boulder to boulder, treee to tree, as it fell.  Therefore I expect the bear to be colored some brown (from dirt), some green (from brush), and some red (from torn skin & fur)."

5,"I keep getting the ""Network Cable Unplugged"" error with Windows XP!? Ok. This is absolutely retarded. I have a network cable, see? I plug it into my iMac and the internet connection works fine. I take out the cable and plug it into an ethernet card which is connected to a laptop with a fresh install of XP, and the internet connection on the laptop automagically doesn't work. Windows keeps telling me that the network cable is unplugged. This, of course, is total BS, as the cable is in there snugly. I know that the computer recognizes the card (I checked; the drivers are installed), but for some reason, it doesn't detect the cable which is plugged in. Strangely enough, not only does the cable work with the iMac, but it also worked on the same exact laptop with the same exact ethernet card when Ubuntu was installed. \n\nIf anyone could help, I'd be much obliged. When you use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer to a hub, switch or router, you use what's called an MDI (straight through) cable.\n\nIn order to connect one computer to another directly, you must use an Ehternet cable with a different pinout called an MDI-X (cross over) cable.\n\nThe reason for this is because your computer is a ""terminal"" device.  It transmits data on a specific wire and expects to receive data on a specific other wire.  Then you connect it to a ""host"" device and it expects same thing, but on the opposite wires.\n\nFor more information, see the article on Ehternet on howstuffworks.com\n\nhttp://computer.howstuffworks.com/ethernet.htm"

It sounds like there's a part of you that would occasionally like to be able to lie back, let go, and let somebody else take over. \n\nRape fantasies are also common among women who have sexual shame or inhibitions from their childhood or past relationships. These women often enjoy the rape fantasy because they are not choosing to have sex and therefore are not accountable for any ""sins."" \n\nFurthermore, the fantasy centers on a man who is so caught up in his passion and desire that he has to take you now. The idea of that level of passion is very exciting for many women."""

3,"What is the best medication to fight Multiple Sclerosis? I have MS, beem diagnoised 11-2002, I am 56 years old, and have been taking LDN and doing just fine, concedering, so far. Holy christmas (literally!)... the last poster, be careful.\n\nI was diagnosed in 1999.  I didn't start taking medications until 2004 (had a bit of denial there)...\nI got a flare-up that forced me to think harder about my future (and a great fiance to boot!).\n\nA lot of people go on the interferons, and Glatiramer acetate, which is what I'm on.  When I decided what to go on, I thought about what I'd have to do for it.  I was a bit worried about giving myself a shot, and I figured that I would need to have the least intrusive method of medication delivery... so I decided subcutaneous (just under the skin).  That cut down the list of interferons... \n\nThen I thought about side effects, a lot of the interferons have flu like symptoms.  When I started the meds, I was feeling weak, pins and needly, and limpy.  I said, do I want to have a cold on top of that.  No siree.\n\nI mean, you really have to talk to your NEURO, and what (s)he recommends.  It just so happened that the first NEURO in 1999, recommended Avonex as he was drinking out of an Avonex branded mug (no foolin!).  That is what turned me off from the med idea in the first place.  My SECOND neuro, he asked me my concerns, and we decided on Copaxone.  Yes, it's daily, but it's under the skin, and it just has local reactions for me as a side effect.\n\nI WAS PETRIFIED of giving myself these shots.  Many of the companies (my drugs, included) have autojectors, so you don't even have to see the needle.  Copaxone (or my doctor, I can't remember, it was so long ago!)... required me to have a home care nurse there the first time to show me how to administer the drugs.

2,"why is the sky blue? it's the age old question.... The sky appears blue because the gases(mainly nitrogen and oxygen) present in our atmosphere vibrate at a specific frequency.  From the light that we can see, ie.. blue, green, red, yellow...etc, the the higher frequency colors are absorbed more by the atmosphere than the lower frequency(actually they're scattered, they still make it to us but indirectly whereas the yellowish color of the sun is more direct).  So blue, green, and violet(violet having the shortest wavelength) are absorbed by the atmosphere, while red, yellow and orange are allowed through.   The color of blue that we perceive the sky varies from day to day based on the content of gases present and the frequency that they vibrate.  It works the same way as light passing through a blue balloon, except in this case the balloon is our atmosphere."

2,"Has an organ been cloned as of yet? I awas having a debate with my husband over whether or not scientists have cloned an organ. I say they have, he says they have not. I thought, however, with the stem cell research, this was the whole point...to get the stem cells to grow into whatever organ was needed?!\n\nDoes anyone have any answers to clarify this debate? At this point, it isn't possible to grow organs, but at some point this may be possible. The idea would be to take some cells and ""instruct"" them, by giving the right amounts of certain molecules, to grow into certain types of cells that would form an organ.\n\nIt will be easier to make replacement cells of a certain type, such as bone marrow, or nerve cells, than to make a whole organ that has many types of cells and a complex architecture. We're still trying to learn all the signals that go into telling cells how to become one type versus another, so there is still a ways to go.\n\nThe stem cell issue comes in because most cells in the adult have already decided what they will be when they grow up, and they can't go back and become anything different. Stem cells haven't decided yet, so they could be ""told"" what to be, when we know all the instructions. The research is very slow now in the United States, because of limitations from the government, but other countries are pulling ahead nicely (and some of our best scientists are leaving to go to those places)."

5,"Why would there be a difference in content from the same site with different browsers? For example, I have been following The Rolling Stones current tour on a couple of sites which post reviews & set lists just after the concerts. I had noticed that one of the postings on Stones Planet had duplicated a\nposting for a Miami concert on 10/17 where it should have been a posting for a Dallas concert on 11/29. I e-mailed the web site and within a half-hour, I received an apology stating the problem had been corrected. Sure enough, when I accessed the site using Internet Explorer, the error had been corrected but when I accessed it using Netscape 7.2, it still had the incorrect posting and remains so nearly 24-hours later. When the tour, currently on break, was posting it's updates after each show, there was almost always a lag of a couple of hours before the same update could be viewed through both browsers. Why should there be any difference at all, once the update has posted, just because a different browser is used? Because every browser has its own memory of what pages looked like, and its own policies (set by you in the Preferences) for when to use that memory. Go back to rolling stones, (the exact page), hold down the shift key and press F5. This should fix it."

1,"Why is marijuana illegal and alcohol still legal? It seems that marijuana has less negative effects than alcohol. Why was marijuana outlawed in the U.S. and not alcohol? Because alcohol contains only alcohol. The effects upon the brain are well known and documented. Marijuana, on the other hand, has hundreds of chemicals, each possibly interacting with the other(s) in ways not yet researched. For instance, a well-known drug test involves snipping off a bit of your hair. if you smoked pot even six months ago, traces of it remain detectible as part of the hair itself, vs. the kidneys elimination if all traces of alcohol from the body within 48 hours. Also, it is suspected that pot may alter the body's DNA, so long-term chronic effects are still unknown."

A few minutes later, the clerk realizes he has made an error and overcharged the trio by $5.  He asks the bellhop to return $5 to the 3 friends who had just checked in.  The bellhop sees this as an opportunity to make $2 as he reasons that the three friends would have a tough time dividing $5 evenly among them; so he decides to tell them that the clerk made a mistake of only $3, giving a dollar back to each of the friends.  He pockets the leftover $2 and goes home for the day!  Now, each of the three friends gets a dollar back, thus they each paid $9 for the room which is a total of $27 for the night.  We know the bellhop pocketed $2 and adding that to the $27, you get $29, not $30 which was originally spent.  Where did the other dollar go???? The $2 should be subtracted from the $27, not added to it -- since they were overcharged by $5, the room actually cost $25.\n\nThey ending up paying $27, $25 for the room and $2 to the bellhop. That $27 plus the $3 refund is the original $30"

And she torn equally between the two of us. the new guy goes to collage with her every day and is in a position where he can make her life a living hell if they were to break up. this is an excrusiating experiance for me as far as emotions go. i get 1 hour of sleep pre night. Because i stay up thinking about her. i know there is no possible way this guy loves her more than me. but he is more finacially stable and is heading the right direction in life. wich of corse makes it that much harder. plus many other things i don't have room to type. so how can i win her back? Or should i not try? It kind of depends on what you were not able to compromise on and if you are willing to give it a try her way.  As far as try to get her back start doing little things for her.  It sounds like you still talk and you must have some idea what kind of things she like.  Surprise her make her feel like she is the best part of your life.  Good luck...

5,"How to save arrays in MySQL with PHP? How would one save an array in MySQL using PHP? If you are using the native mysql drivers in PHP, then there are no MySQL arrays, you are creating an object that you iterate over. The idea is to iterate over the object's results and put those results into an array. Observe:\n\n<?php\n// Connecting, selecting database\n$link = mysql_connect('mysql_host', 'mysql_user', 'mysql_password')\n   or die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());\necho 'Connected successfully';\nmysql_select_db('my_database') or die('Could not select database');\n\n// Performing SQL query\n$query = 'SELECT * FROM my_table';\n$result = mysql_query($query) or die('Query failed: ' . mysql_error());\n\n// Printing results in HTML\necho ""<table>&#92;n"";\nwhile ($line = mysql_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {\n   echo ""&#92;t<tr>&#92;n"";\n   foreach ($line as $col_value) {\n       echo ""&#92;t&#92;t<td>$col_value</td>&#92;n"";\n   }\n   echo ""&#92;t</tr>&#92;n"";\n}\necho ""</table>&#92;n"";\n\n// Free resultset\nmysql_free_result($result);\n\n// Closing connection\nmysql_close($link);\n?> \n\nThe line you are looking for is:\nwhile ($line = mysql_fetch_array($result, MYSQL_ASSOC))\n\nBasically, mysql_fetch_array will return an associtive array containing the column name as the key, and the data for that column into $line. Then you can further push that into an array container.\n\nvar $data = array();\n...\n$data[] = $line;\n...\n\nYou cannot otherwise take a mysql result and make it an array, you must iterate over the object.\n\nFYI - I do not reccomend using the native PHP drivers. Using an abstraction library makes your code so much more portable. Using native drivers may make for quick coding, but you loose so much more in the end. \n\nI've included links to Pear::DB, ADODB, and PDO as possible libraries to look at. There are more, these are just examples.\n\nHope that helps."

I am unable to install even DOS.\nAny ideas how I can get data from the second (extended) partition? There are various procedures to recover data from standard ATA Hard Disks. If you are relatively unexperienced with computers, I would suggest going to a professional in your area to restore the data. If you're willing to take the time try stellarinfo, it's highly recommended. I've left a couple of links for you as well. Also, you may try Norton Ghost, ghost the partition or disk and then go back in through Ghost Explorer and extract the files that way."

5,"What's the best way to IM between two computers with unreliable connections? I regularly need to IM with someone whose net connection is unreliable - it drops packets frequently. I've tried a number of messengers - Yahoo silently loses messages, as does GTalk. MSN usually notices that it can't deliver, but sometimes silently loses messages, and never re-attempts delivery. I haven't tried AIM yet (I've had a little bit of trouble with it and my firewall), but I don't have a good reason to expect it will work better.\n\nIs there a program I should be using to communicate? The ideal solution would notify me when it fails to deliver a message, and continue trying to send it for a period of time, but not spam the recipient with multiple identical messages when the packets go through. I need to run it on Windows XP, and having to run my own server is a disadvantage, but one I can handle.\n\nDoes such a program exist, or should I dig out my networking books and start looking into reliability engineering? I have found the new Yahoo Messagenger to be good at what you need. Now that it has a ""memory"" of the messages sent by the person, and it has the feature of waiting for the message to be read by the reciever. It works VERY well on 4 of my computers, but has problems with my VAIO computer with the XP MEDIA os. Make sure you have the new version at:\nhttp://messenger.yahoo.com/ to recieve all of the features."

If there was a top 40 of backmasked songs, then ""Stairway to Heaven"" by Led Zeppelin would be at the top. This song contains many backward messages. Here is one of them that occurs right at the very end of the song.. It says: ""Play backwards. Hear words sung.""\n\nHowever, by far the most controversial backward messages on the song can be found in the following soundtrack. They say backwards: ""Its my sweet Satan. The one whose little path would make me sad whose power is fake (indeterminate gibberish - some people claim this says, He gives you 666) There was a little toolshed where he made us suffer, sad Satan.""\n\nA complete analysis of the reversals in this song and their meanings can be found in this extract: Stairway to Where? from the book, ""Reverse Speech: Voices From The Unconscious.""

It's hard to pick the perfect answer, especially since some of the answers are subjective. For instance, if I asked someone for what they thought the BEST place to eat was, I can't really qualify that. So that would probably be left up to a vote and take a consensus. \n\nAs for picking answers myself, if there appears to be a lot of thought put into the answer and it includes sources, all the better. The questions that I've personally asked, thus far, usually there has been one answer that typifies this.

7,"Titanic Questions? How could an iceberg hit an unsinkable ship?\nWhy did lower classes have to wait?Isn't it the crews fault for not letting them go and for almost 1,500 people dying?Why didn't Titanic have enough life belts and life boats?Why didn't they prepare for something like this? Finally, why did people want to take and sell treasures found on the Titanic? Shouldn't Titanc's victims rest in peace? The answers to your questions in the order asked:\n\n(1) Any ship can hit an iceberg, it's not like the iceberg is living and could have moved out of the way because it WANTED to. \n\n(2) In those days, the poor were considered ""third class"" individuals, and so on the ship were put into the ""third class"" accomodations. As such, the crew was directed to make sure the first and second class passengers were attended to first. That wasn't right to do at all, but that's just how it was. \n\n(3) It's mainly the fault of the shipbuilders who only put 20 lifeboats on the ship, which wasn't enough for half the passengers. Sharing in the blame would have to be the officer who tried to turn the ship when it was too close already, since the ship wouldn't have sunk if it hit the iceberg head on. It was also the captain's fault for not taking the necessary precautions with the ship when he knew they were headed directly into an ice field.\n\n(4) The shipbuilders wanted as much ""ooh and ahh"" over the ship as they could get from the public. That's why they fostered the belief that the ship was ""unsinkable"", and that the ship itself was one big lifeboat. Those in charge also felt that the extra boats would have cluttered up the ship's deck. \n\n(5) They didn't prepare for this because they were arrogant and felt that they had the greatest ship in all of history and nothing would ever happen to it.\n\n(6) Greed is why people tried to take and sell Titanic artifacts. It was all about the $$$. \n\n(7) Titanic's victims are long-gone. Either they were consumed by organisms at the bottom of the ocean, or like anyone in the grave, their bodies returned to the dust."

2,"why do elements of oppisite charges attract? in chemistry element attract why One property of matter is the electric charge. Most sub-atomic particles have either a positive (+) or negative (-) electrical charge. Those that don't are considered neutral. The most common charged particles are the electron and proton. Atoms with an excess of electrons are called negative ions. Those with missing electrons are called positive ions. There is an electrical field that flows between opposite charges, causing an electrical force. This results in an attractive force between the opposite charges and a repelling force between like charges."

The person who committed homicide always has another chance at making a new life; starting with a clean start. I only have once exception; HITLER, DIE NAZI DIE! As long as the person is guilty, and the crime is severe, I think it is a good thing.\n\nFor one thing, why should a cold blooded murder get the chance he never gave to his victim?  Victims (usually  innocent people) do not get a chance to start a new life, do they? Plus why should he get a lifetime of freebies (free meals, free clothes, free cable) and even some freebies that the law-abiding cannot afford (like free gym, free college courses) after taking a life?\n\nA good alternative would be to use the worst of the worst (rapists, pedohiles, murderers) for testing instead of the innocent animals.  At least then they could serve a purpose in society, and maybe even give a little back."

4,"When was the Parthenon built and why? PLease answer this by December 20th, please. I need this for a test to study! URGENT! The work on Parthenon started in 447 BC.  Work on the temple continued until 432 BC.  The Parthenon is a Doric peripteral temple, which means that it consists of a rectangular floor plan with a series of low steps on every side, and a colonnade (8 x 17) of Doric columns extending around the periphery of the entire structure. Each entrance has an additional six columns in front of it. The larger of the two interior rooms, the naos, housed the cult statue. The smaller room (the opisthodomos) was used as a treasury.\n\nSome historians believe that Athens concluded a peace treaty with Persia in 449, two years before work began on the Parthenon. The significance of this would be that the Delian League/Athenian Empire continued to exist, even after the reason for its existence (a mutual defense league against the Persians) had ceased to be valid. In other words it was now openly acknowledged that Athens was not just the head of the Greek defense league but actually an imperial master over other Greek states. The decision by the Athenians in 454 BC to move the League treasury from the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delos to the Athenian acropolis points in the same direction. Because the Parthenon was built with League funds, the building may be read as an expression of the confidence of the Athenians in this newly naked imperialism."

9,"how could you satisfy your girl friend? if you can The truth is this, there is no way to satisfy your girlfriend, or anyone, for that matter.  Men and women, it seems, have this belief that they can ""please"" each other or ""make"" each other happy.  It is a nice thought, but it doesn't really happen that way.  Think about this, you are upset and your friend tells you a joke that makes you feel better...right?  Wrong.  You chose to feel better by seeing the humor in the joke and allowed yourself to open up enough to be influenced by the humor, losing your grip on those negative thoughts and feelings you had previously.  It is the same with women, in this case, your girlfriend.  \n\nYou can't satisfy her, but there is something you can do to improve the situation.  First start with you, being the best person you can be...to yourself, to others, and to her.  Be confident, be yourself, be all the things you want to be when fear and self-consiousness set in, and be true to who you are.  Then be selfless, helpful, caring, compassionate, diligent, and patient with those around you.  As for your girlfriend, you should follow your heart, care for her, give her yourself, be WITH her when you are around her, share, be thoughtful and kind, and show her that you care.  Although you cannot ""force"" or ""make"" her do anything, you can still be the best person possible, making each day you live worth living, making yourself a person of value, and creating a certain magic in your life.  All of these things will not only draw better people to you in your life, but your girlfriend will be more ""open"" to your influenc and ""willing"" to share whatever you wish with you.  \n\nA last note.  Women ""feel"" rather than ""think"" their ways into better relationships.  Men are mostly the other way.  If you love her and care for her, you should take the risk and tell her what is in your heart as often as you can, show her what you feel without the ""act"", and do for her what you would want done for yourself.  The best advice in any relationship, including the one you have with yourself, is this: ""If you don't want people to treat you like an @ssho!e, then don't act like one"".....in your case it would sound more like this ""If you want to satisfy her, then let her satisfy you"".  Do all the things to her that you want her to do to you (or have done to you, if you are content in the relationship).  Relationships are a balance, and if yours needs some adjustment, then make those adjustments.  Don't worry if you think you are working too hard, when she realizes what you are doing, she will be more than willing to do her part as well (if she is right for you, that is....and doing this will give you a good indicator if she is or isn't ""the one""....)\n\nI hope this helped.  Good luck!"

I am using Nero 6 bundled version and tried Winon CD power edition 5, but the end results were the same. I have wasted too many CDs. Sometimes its works fine with rewritable CDS. CD copying is also aborted by the writer. Is my lens defective? Please guide me. cheap cd's will do that all the time if there not cheap cd's then yes your righter may have gone bad but not to likely"

It seems that our country has developed a sense that standards for this office don't exist. All you  have to be is a white christian male over 35 and you are eligible. You don't need to be honest, have experience in any of the details of what the job requires, or have a resume of previous experience that shows excellence.\n    The Republican Party should be ashamed for even thinking of placing his name up for nomination for the presidency.  We all know he doesn't do the thinking on policy. If he doesn't read the newspapers, he certainly can't read Presidential Briefing Memos warning of an attack by Bin Laden. \n     One should know something about the world outside of the United States to win this office and have some positive experience in government. He got elected by more than half of the American people.  What have you accomplished that makes you so bright?"

2,"Could we all become separate species..? Looking at the various cultural and genetic drift that is visible on our planet today, and the wide variety of human types, is it plausible to suggest that we could all one day adapt and evolve into separate, unique species who are no longer able to interbreed and have unique characteristics? Given today's atmosphere (socio-economic, not the sky), it is not possible.\n\nLook to Darwin to see WHY species differentiated.\nOne reason is they change to better thrive in their surroundings.  We humans tend to alter our surroundings to more fit us.\nAnother reason is physical barrier (and then go back to number one), so two populations evolve differently...due to their different surroundings.  The only problem is that I live next door to an Italian, an American Indian (1/8), and a Pakistani.  World travel is a thing of relative ease.  Breeding is so intermixed between populations that you will not have a barrier-method break to help evolution.\n\nIn summary, I believe we will not become different species of human."

And they would come up with all these ways to dodge the question -- like ""I went to school in state X"" or whatnot.  I have found that if people say ""I went to school in Massachusetts"" then people just say ""oh, where"" and it drags on the conversation.  I think it's really arrogant to think you're so special you have to try to hide where you went.  If you went to Harvard and someone asks, then say ""Harvard"" and move on.  If you went to Yale, don't say ""Connecticut"" because that just invites follow up questions.  Just say ""Yale"" and move on.  I think it's worse and more arrogant to try to hide where you went than to just answer a question factually if people ask.  It REALLY annoys me when people feel they have to lie for some false humility's sake.  What do you think? I agree.  I do not believe that anyone should be ashamed of anything.  You can not change the past and if you wanted to do it you should be proud or at least willing to accept the consequences of what you have done.  If you kill someone take the blame, if you went to an ivy league school take the looks."

There is a saying ""emotionally spent"" which relates the terms you are mentioning.\n\nEmotions of any great amount cause phsyiological changes (i.e. increase blood pressure and heart rate, change temperature, metabolism, etc.)  These are all elements of what we term as ""stress"".  \n\nIf this happens on extreme levels, yes, you can experience a ""hang over"" of sorts.  In some ways you can think of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrom as similar in concept to the ""hang over"" you are talking about."

When applying for a mortgage at a young age as a soldier my girl wwas tranferred to my installation so we plan to move in together when the financing came around my real estate agent asked the question were we married and we stated no and the agent ask will you get married some day and we said probably so. So the agent advised us to sign as a couple which I now know was bad advise.  Because the relation didn't work after 18 months. and now my ex girl is sueing for half interest in the house after 25 years of no payment on the mortgage or upkeep of the property--I plan to represent myself in court due to the lack of fund to hire a lawyer. I do not see her as co-owner. She left the house in 79 and expressed no interest in the house an d took all household goods.  I beleive she've been compensated for the limit $ invested at closing.  She is filing co owner.  Any advise. You might have a hard time.  Regardless of your marital status at the time of signing you could still be what is called tenants in common.  Any two people can be tenants in common.  Go back to your original contract and read what it says.  If it names both of you and both of you agreed then you are probably tenants in common.  Each having half undivided interest.\n\nBut this also means she would be responsible for half  of anything like taxes, mortgage payments and any other expenses with the property.\n\nAbout the only claim you can make to the property would be adverse possesion in he half interest but it might be a stretch.\n\nBut after 25 years of no payment of duties it might equal her half interest anyway.\n\nI would ask for accounting and partition....but see a lawyer."

People tend to fall in love with people who are similar to themselves.  Guys who fall in love with a shallow, vacuous girl are likely (but not always) shallow and vacuous themselves.  However, if you don't like the guys that approach you, that points to a different issue.  You should think about what image you may be projecting.  The guys you are attracting are basing whether or not they'll approach you generally on first impressions, so you may be making a first impression that's not in tune with who you really are.  It's a mistake to dress like the girl who's with the guy that you like, because he may like that girl for a myriad of other reasons besides her appearance.  For instance, how do you know that's not his sister or ex-girlfriend?  Talking to him would answer questions like these.  This illustrates why conversation, interaction, and  getting to know people is the best advice for forming lasting relationships."

Take its webaddress and put some html code in your signature, which shows the image(It the same notmal HTML code that you use to show a picture inside a normal webpage). For example, showing you an example with text, if you write :\n\n<b>ABC</b>, the letters ABC will be in bold in your signature. Hope you can write the code for including the image.

While in most countries the cat is said to have nine lives, in Arab and Turkish proverbs poor puss has a mere seven lucky lives and in Russia, is said to-survive nine deaths."

Was watching the director's cut, where at the end, the main character watches a film of his birth, returns to his mother's womb and strangles himself. Apparently, this is not how the original version ends, the ones shown in theatres. How does this movie originally end? ""In the theatrical release, he uses a home movie to go back to the party where he first met the little girl. He tells her he hates her and never wants to see her ever again, and that if she tries, he will kill her and her family; naturally prompting her to want to leave with her mother who is getting a divorce. She and her brother do not stay with their father, thereby avoiding everything that had happened in their lives to that point. \n\nHe grows up with his other childhood friend; they go on to college, and he winds up becoming a respectable psychotherapist 8 - 10 years later. At the closing scene, he and the girl pass on the street, each considers looking back, as if recognizing the other (obviously Ashton recognizes her), but neither actually decides to turn around and talk to the other person... they go on with their bittersweet lives without each other."""

He has a better understanding of what life is like for the people, however, he also sees the hatred THEY have for Americans! Is hard to help people when they are trying to kill you!  He(and his family) feel sorry for the people who have to live in such horrible conditions.  His concern is this....How do you tell the good from the bad? How do you know who to help and who is a terrorist that wants nothing more than to kill you? Its a tuff question, and I think it depends on who you ask.  The general American public, that has no education about the situations in the Middle East most likely generalize and hate that race...HOWEVER, for those of us who do have some sort of inside knowledge(military), we are a little more understanding.  We feel sorry and want to help, yet at the same time, dont know who to trust.  I hope this in understandable.\nNow...do I or my husband agree to the USA being there? No Not at all, we dont want to be there! However, we must do what the chain of command says, or we go to prisson and can be put to death! When most of these soldiers joined the Military, there was no war anyplace, so we didnt ask for this, we may not agree with it, but we are bound by a legal contract to do what Bush tells us.  Now, MY husbamd is a medic...his job is to save lives...ALL LIVES.  I dont know if the US Military has or has not raped the people there...I can only speak for MY UNIT....and MY UNIT has never considered anything like that, and I cant believe other units would either. Im not saying its not true, im saying its hard to believe.  War is a horrible thing and horrible things happen in wars.  We dont blame the people in Iraq for hating us...as said, we invaded their land, and they are being lied too and threatened by the terorists.  If I was in that situation I would probably act the same way, but untill the people in Iraq learn to defend themselves from horrible people like Sadam and Osoma..then they will always be in horrible living conditions."

About 2 weeks ago, I asked the same question, and people seemed to be telling me that Math was invented and it does not exist in nature.\n\nI completely disagree with this. ""a + b = b + a"" may not be what Universe be calling this law, but anywhere you go in the universe, this law can still be applied. We have our own language for Math, but that does not mean WE created Math. Let's say, for the sake of argument, evolution was really true, and cats existed many years before humans. They were not called cats, and as soon as English language was being used, the animals we recognize for their fur and meow are called ""Cats"" by us. Now does that mean we invented cats? You may disagree with me, but I would really like to see why.\n\nAlso, for those of you not aware of Phi, it is a mathematical constant, and appears to be everywhere in nature. There are many things in nature that we come up with symbols to describe.  We invented the symbols to describe it; however, we did not invent the natural phenomenon.\n\nFor example circles are all over the place in nature.  If you divide the circumference of a circle by it's diameter the result is pi.  We invented the term ""Pi"" to describe this; however, we did not invent the natural phenomenon."

If you compress it, but allow the hest caused by compressing to leave, then you'll get nothing.  It is possible if you have an insulated system to compress it in such a way that temperature of the water rises, but at higher pressures, the temperature needed to boil water increases.  If the water, once heated by comprsession, were to be rapidy brought to a lower pressure through a throttling valve, it could be vaporized.\n\nBut really, if you want water to boil, you should *DECREASE* the pressure.  In out space, water at room temperature would instantly boil due to the low pressure involved."

The name ""chaos theory"" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data. \nWhen was chaos first discovered? The first true experimenter in chaos was a meteorologist, named Edward Lorenz. In 1960, he was working on the problem of weather prediction. He had a computer set up, with a set of twelve equations to model the weather. It didn't predict the weather itself. However this computer program did theoretically predict what the weather might be. \n\nOne day in 1961, he wanted to see a particular sequence again. To save time, he started in the middle of the sequence, instead of the beginning. He entered the number off his printout and left to let it run. \n\nWhen he came back an hour later, the sequence had evolved differently. Instead of the same pattern as before, it diverged from the pattern, ending up wildly different from the original. (See figure 1.) Eventually he figured out what happened. The computer stored the numbers to six decimal places in its memory. To save paper, he only had it print out three decimal places. In the original sequence, the number was .506127, and he had only typed the first three digits, .506.   ...(c this site)"

Can't afford the ongoing expensive of a cellphone so a picturecamera is probably out of the question, but maybe a digital camera?  All advice welcomed.  T minus 2 and counting.... An ipod is a great gift.. I love mine and I never really go anywhere without it..you will need to download itunes on your computer so she can get music for it. and since ipods have so many accessories they are always nice too.. the cases help protect the body and screen which is good and the ipod bose stereo docks are also very nice but are pretty costly. you could also pick her up an itunes giftcard(sold wherever ipods are sold) so she can get new music right away. \nI got my sister the new scene it dvd trivia game and its a lot of fun we have a few versions already and my whole family loves it.. also if she has a favorite tv show.. dvd box sets make great gifts.\nand digital cameras are definatley an awesome gift. you can even find them now on sale with included printer docks so you can just print the photos from your home at your own convenience."

So, here is a tricky answer from my side.\n\nOn their current form India looks capable of winning the WC 2007, Infactany team can win it. If we look at the ICC ODI Ranking Table then we would see that Australia is 1st and way ahead. But competition is strict from 2nd to 7th as South Africa is marginally ahead of Pakistan who is followed by India, England, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand. This shows how close these teams are when it comes to their standard of play and their consistency. It also means that from 2nd to 7th Position any team can beat its opponent (Even Australia, As New Zealand has just proved it by beating Australia in a record chase). So I think any of the Top Seven teams can won the World Cup on its day. Now a days ODI cricket has become so unpredictable that any thing can happen. \n\nComing back to the question, I would say that Aussies are favorites to defend their title but a bad day can stop their march towards a dream hat trick. Apart from Australia, every other team (i.e.; England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa) have equal chance to win the WC 2007. Any of the above mentioned team can make Aussies pay for their mistakes on the certain day. So, I would say that, India has equal chance of winning the World Cup 2007 as any other Top 7 team, with Aussies being the Favorites."

I would start to plant the seed with the landlord soon. You will be in a better position to negotiate with him if you have more time and thought invested. Start by dropping hints and let him know what you like and dislike about where you are. Also check out what similar areas in other retail locations are renting for.

7,"How can I contact the Sprint Fraud Management department. It seems as thought there is no way to contact them? I was wrongly charged for some services that I did not order from Sprint. I contacted Sprint's Fraud Management, filled out the paperwork as instructed and mailed them in. Its been three months and I have not heard anything from that department. I have not been able to contact them to find out the status of my complaint. My question is: ""How can I deal with this problem and get that false charged off my credit report?"" I recommend checking your credit report to see if Sprint has placed this account on there.  The only company that gives free credit reports offered by the government is annualcreditreport.com.  If the Sprint account is on there but you never opened any account with them you might be the victim of identity theft.  Your first step is to place a fraud victim security alert on your credit report which lasts approximentally 3 months to a year depending on the credit bureau.  Your next step is to go to your local police department and file an identity theft report.  Once you have a copy of your police report send it in along with a letter disputing the account as not belonging to you to the credit bureau.  They will send a copy of your police report to Sprint for you and block the account from appearing on your credit report."

7,"Is it better to leave the heat on at the same temp or lower it at night/when you are out? If it is better to turn it down at times, wouldn't the heater kick in more (and therefore use up more gas) to warm up the extra chilly air? The gas company tells me to leave it on at the same temp throughout, others tell me otherwise - and I have no idea who is right. Should I really trust the company who stands to gain more profit  from me getting higher bills (even though I lean towards their rationale)? You are better off turning it down at night. You can get a programmable thermostat so you don't have to do it manually. You can get a 7 day programmable (recommended if you will be changing the temp every day) or a 5/2 (changes it only on weekends). I'd recommend a White-Rodgers 1F80-361"

5,"What is a blog? I have head this word a lot of times but did not understand it. what does it mean? A blog is a website for which an individual or a group frequently generates text, photographs, video or audio files, and/or links, typically (but not always) on a daily basis. The term is a shortened form of weblog. Authoring a blog, maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called ""blogging"". Individual articles on a blog are called ""blog posts,"" ""posts,"" or ""entries"". The person who posts these entries is called a ""blogger"".\n\n    * Electronic communities existed before internetworking. For example the AP wire was, in effect, similar to a large chat room with ""wire fights"" and electronic conversations. Another pre-digital electronic community, amateur (or ""ham"") radio, allowed individuals who set up their own broadcast equipment to communicate with others directly. Ham radio also had logs called ""glogs"" that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s.\n    * Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, e-mail lists and bulletin boards. In the 1990s Internet forum software, such as WebX, created running conversations with ""threads."" Threads are topical connections between messages on a electronic ""corkboard."" See ""Common terms,"" below.\n    * Diarists kept journals on the Web: most called themselves online diarists, journalists, journallers, or journalers. A few called themselves escribitionists. The Open Pages webring contained members of the online-journal community. The first famous journaller was probably Justin Hall.\n    * Other forms of journals kept online also existed. A notable example was game programmer John Carmack's widely read journal, published via the finger protocol.\n    * Websites, including both corporate sites and personal homepages, had and still often have ""What's New"" or ""News"" sections, often on the index page and sorted by date."

If you are using a textarea with a HTMLArea (WYSIWYG) and you want to stores the styles, the solution is to store in the database all the content of the posted field (when you submit the page the content of the textarea will include the formated text, e.g. <p align='center'><b>foo</b></p>). Next, when you want to extract the content from the data base, it's piece of cake because if you want to show it, it's already formated and you will see as the original. \nIf you want to put it in the textarea just write in the HTML source file the following:\n<textarea ...><% // echo the extracted content here %></textarea>\n\nI hope this will help you."

If you blow up a photo and you see a lot of pixels, there really is no way to clear it up, even though you may sometimes see people on TV do it.\n\nIf sharpening doesn't work (be sure to use ""unsharp mask"", it allows a greater degree of control than other sharpening options), then I don't there's anything you can do. You can't add information to a photo that is not already there (which is what you are doing when you blow up a digital image and see pixelization)."

7,"What kind of process was used to change Michael Jackson's skin color? How much did it costs? Is this procedure available to general public? Are there any side affects or dangers on future health? No. It is not available to general public. He had to submit to this procedure due to the skin desease he has called Vitiligo. \n\nThis illness destroys the skin pigmentation in some areas of the body... causing that in a black person skin (like Michael) appear big white patches.\nThe process Michael had was to destroy the pigmentation of the rest of the still coloured skin when the illness was too advanced and he could not put make up on the white patches like he did in the beginning (Late 70s, early 80s)\n\nAlthough I think it is not too dangerous, since its a common procedure to treat patients with advanced Vitiligo it has side effects. This process destroys the pigmentation of the skin, that is the natural protection from the sun, so you have to be very careful with your skin. Especially you cannot be exposed to the sun. That's the reason Michael wears dark clothes, mask, fedora and umbrella most of the times he goes out.\nAnd probably you will have to put some creams for the skin, sun blocker or even take special medicine. \n\nThough I'm not so sure of how much this may cost... I bet it's a lot."

I usually declare things pretty boldly, and then I don't get those items. I don't think it's in bad form to send around a wish list to your relatives and friends. I actually prefer it when I get a wish list for someone 'cause I always worry that I'm getting them something they don't want.\n\nIf you're into books, games, dvds, or cds, Amazon has a wish list function built in that's searchable by name, so creating a wishlist on there and letting people know about it would be a good way to hint to them what you want. Plus it lets them pick depending on how much they want to spend on you."
10,"Ok...""D""...The original question about invasion of privacy has been rephrased.....? My hotel, in Colorado, (as well as all the hotels in this brand) require a mailing address in order to check in. The reservation process can NOT be completed unless an address is put into the system. A guest last night told me it was against the law for me to ask for his mailing address...that it was an invasion of his privacy. He proceeded to tell me that in his business- banking- that it was an invasion of privacy to ask for an address. I asked him if I were to show up at his bank and try to open an account without giving an address, would he do it, and he said that he is legally not allowed to ask for an address. I disagreed with him and he gave a false address anyway. \n\nPlease, in the future, refrain from treating me as an imbecile and simply ask me to add more information to my question. Me not giving enough information in the original question means only that I am unfamiliar with laws and NOT that I am uneducated. : ) Tell him, that if his check or credit card ""bounces"", how are you going to know where to look for him...\n\nAlso, if he pays cash, and then trashes the room, you still want to know where you can ""track him down!""\n\nThink of it as a short-term rental agreement. He doesn't get what he wants, until you get what you need, or at least have the ""security"" to know how you would be able to recover that consideration in the future, should the need arise!"

Britney Spears has filed a $20 million libel lawsuit against Us Weekly, charging the celebrity magazine published a false story reporting she and husband Kevin Federline had made a sex tape and were worried about its release.The lawsuit, filed Monday, seeks $10 million in libel damages and $10 million for misappropriating the 24-year-old pop singer's name and image to promote sales. It also seeks unspecified punitive damages.""We have a very credible source and we stand by our story,"" Us Weekly spokesman Alex Dudley said Tuesday in a statement.According to the lawsuit, the article was published Oct. 17 in the magazine's ""Hot Stuff"" column and claimed that Spears and Federline feared the release of a secret sex tape, which they had viewed with their estate planning lawyers.The article stated that Spears gave a copy of the tape to the lawyers on Sept. 30 and that she and her husband were ""acting goofy the whole time"" while watching the video. Your Thoughts? She's way over rated and just wants to be in the spotlight like she used to be"

3,"Why do people come to the EMERGENCY ROOM expecting IMMEDIATE SERVICE and INSTANT RELIEF? Half the people that come to my ER have NON-EMERGENT complaints and the half that do, think they should be treated as if they're dying. Most people don't know what pain is. They think that life can exist with NO PAIN and NO SICKNESS. They think just because they're being seen by a Physician that there should be some kind of INSTANT DIAGNOSIS with a MAGICAL PILL that make all their pain and weakness go away. REALITY CHECK!! There's no such thing. With the happiness and joy that life brings there is also sometimes PAIN and SADNESS. It's unavoidable. When you come to the ER, don't expect MCDONALD'S drive-thru style service with %100 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. When someone goes to the Emergency Room it's usually because they have never felt so sick. Or had such pain before. They hope they can be treated right away because it is scarey to feel so bad and they don't want it to get worse. If you can't be understanding and caring to these people then find another job. You don't seem to be the type that has deep enough feelings for somenoe else."

6,"Dan Greenhalgh was drafted in the 24th round by the Phillies in 1971.  Did he ever play professional baseball? Greenhalgh was drafted as a pitcher from Folsom High School in Folsom, Texas as the 548th pick in the 1971 June draft.  This much I know is true.  He is currently, alledgedly, a pro baseball scout.  There is no record of him having ever played for the Phillies according to their media guide, I can find no major league stats for him anywhere and I have not located a baseball card for him.  He is dating my sister and claims he played in the majors for 7 years, mostly with the Giants.  I think he is a fraud, but perhaps he at least spent some time in the minors or, though unlikely, maybe I just haven't looked in the right places.  Anyone who can provide me some answers would do me a great service and might just prevent a relationship disaster from happening. Baseball_Reference.com lists every major league player that has appeared in a game, and does not list Greenhalgh. (It essentially replaced the old Baseball Encyclopedia.)\n\nIf his claim is that he was a professional player, that is certainly possible, since minor league players are professionals, and you know he was drafted.   He may also have been a coach or instructor of some kind.  There are no good complete sources listing minor league players or coaches, or even scouts.  Much baseball scouting is done by people who are essentially amateurs, who receive a commision for refering good prospects if they find one."

I would check your manual or specs to make sure that it doesn't already have a card in it.  If it doesn't read on.\n\nIf you want to use WiFi in your home then you will need a router.  My personal favorite is anything by Netgear but any basic WiFi router should serve your needs.\n\nAs I said above if your laptop doesn't already have a WiFi card, then you will need to get a PCMCIA or USB wireless adapter.\n\nI would bet though, that the new laptop does already have a WiFi adapter in it."

1,"Why, as Christians, we do not celebrate Hanukkah? This is a celebration that dates back before Christ.? Christ was a Jew and if we follow the teachings that happened in the Old Testament, then why do we not celebrate that, too? A very sensitive question to be sure. Hanukkah means re-dedication and it is a time when present-day Jews re-dedicate their faith. As many people know it is certainly not as important of a holiday as Passover, Yom Kippur, Shavuot, and other Jewish holidays. Most of the over-importance heaped on Hanukkah is due to its timing when comparing the Hebrew calendar to the Roman calendar. I personally find it ironic that the 25th of Kislev (the Hebrew calendar date for the first night of Hanukkah) is associated with the 25th of December (the Roman calendar date for the observance of Christmas). \n\nSo on to your specific question. There is no good answer why Christians do not celebrate Hanukkah. In the spirit of global tolerance and of coming together Christians may want to light a menorah to usher in the holiday time. After all there are an increasing number of Christians that celebrate the Passover holiday; even if it is likened to Christ's Last Supper which was undoubtably a Seder. \n\nOne of the most poignant discussions on the significance and relevance of Hanukkah to Christians is from Reverend Ricky Hoyt. I have included it as source. \n\nHappy holidays!!"

10,"How is it to be homosexual in USA? Yes, that's my question. I've seen so many American series with homosexual (men) in it, of which I remember ""Spin City"" the most. But I'm not sure that series gives the correct picture of homosexual men/women in USA. Thanks. There's no one correct picture of homosexual men, because everyone experiences it differently.  And of course television shows are trying to entertain you rather than being strictly accurate, so that changes things.\n\nI have known many gay men (and my next door neighbors are lesbians) and in urban areas, gays are generally accepted without it being a big deal to anyone.  They rightly point out that sexuality is only a small part of someone's entire life and personality, so it's poor manners to make too big a deal of it.\n\nThat said, homosexuals still have to deal with harassment, which becomes more of an issue in rural areas.  Also many families are not comfortable with their sons and daughters being gay which can also cause strain."

Whats the truth here? i'll tell you what, you want a straight up answer? i'll give you one! all PC crap aside. i have been all over this planet and seen some pretty awesome things and dated some very foreign women. in the end i have learned that there is two things that make this a little more difficult than dating some one of your own class and ethniticity. 1) parents- they make life difficult on every level of this because they are usually stuck in a oneminded track of how things ought to be. usualy because thats how they were brought up. but even thats a poor excuse for their offten tired and outdated principles. most times they just have a cankering of racial bigotry in their heads just like everyone else. they usually make things twice as difficult on their dughter/son as what things already are and in the end the child will usually claim allegiance to them and their wishes. it snot fair and you cant really do much about it. this is usually the biggest reason for ""intermixed"" relationships to fail. 2) each other- you to individuals are in most cases born of two completely different worlds. in each of these worlds there are certain rules and traditions that are generally expected to be followed without question (parents usually play a role in this also). often times you two individuals get these rules and traditions crossed or confused and guess what? problems occur! whats worse, is mosot times you blame eachother for not understanding the other or you tell eachother that the other refuses to listen or learn. the fact is, both times it all depends on the want or need to make it work. it can and often times does work out, but not without a whole lot of headache and elbow grease. you want to take this person on, good, but make damn well sure they want to take you on. there is a such thing as ""slumming it"", and you will find people out there that know they are going to end up with a person of their own race and class but are interested in playing with something a little differernt for a while. more often than not, and dont take this personal, but it is usually the female that gets this idea. guys dont usually particulary care too much about and too tell you the truth, the most bigoted and hard headed people i have ever met were mothers. they can play hell on their children if they dont approve of them spending their lives with some white boy, or this black girl of yours, blah,blah,blah..its hard man, you just got to have a pair and go for it in the end if its what you want. sometimes you cant control the outcome, but you can work to make the outcome better than it would be if you just left it for what it is on ts own. thats the truth in it from how i see things. everybody is different, thats how i look at things too. nothing ever exactly works out too plan. there wil always be a glitch or hitch somewhere, just make it work for you and your other instead of getting stuck on it. if your in that relationship than you should both know that it isnt interracial, its interpersonal. you two, together, or you two falling apart. thats the best i can explain it to you."

In nearly any case, you will not remain pregnant if you have your period, most especially if it was that early after conception."

It also use to have some major cultural biases which causes white men to score better, although it is claimed that has largly been fixed.  Also much of college success is about time managment.

Thank you. experience has shown me that if you pick based upon money you will be unhappy in the future.  \n\nyou will find a job, no matter what you do.  question is what you like.\n\nif you really want to pick taking everything into consideration - future employment, tolerability over time, pay - pick medical imaging - particularly interventional radiology.\n\ngood luck."

Guaifenesin (guai for short) is an expectorant medication that helps thin and loosen mucus in the lungs, and is found in most over-the-counter cold medicines. I have read that guai can help treat IBS, but that it (Guaifenesin) must be used in pure form either with prescription tablets, or over-the-counter strength tablets or powder. Anybody have any experience using this to help with their IBS? Since you are asking for a personal experience with this drug, I cannot be of any help.  And there are very few people who were treated with guaifenesin for IBS cause its still an anecdotal treatment but you might wanna grab a book called The Guaifenesin Guide: For Treating Chronic Fatigue, Fibromyalgia, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (Paperback) written by Gregory K.

9,"i want know about love deeply? to know what is love deeply and a good teacher of word of God Scientific evidence strongly suggests that to maintain emotional and physical health we have to know how to relate to each other in a caring way. The undeniable evidence is that anger, anxiety and depression, on one hand, and love and intimacy on the other, affect health and recovery from illness. This findings have been elaborated by Dean Ornish MD in Love and Survival. The Scientific Basis for the Healing Power of Intimacy. (1997)  He writes: \n\n“…love and intimacy are at the root of what makes us sick and what makes us well... I am not aware of any factor in medicine -- not diet, not smoking, not stress, not genetics, not drugs, not surgery—that has greater  impact on our quality of life, incidence of illness and premature death from all causes.” \n\nYet, caring (love to be blunt,) which is presumed to be based on a mammalian instinct, strongly allied with survival is fraught with difficulties and is becoming increasingly difficult to exercise in our culture. Hoping to counteract these trends, I endeavor to teach people the simple, basic transactions that constitute the loving experience. This practice is based on three concepts: Strokes, The Stroke Economy and Opening the Heart. \n\nPuzzled by the difficulties that people have when exchanging strokes I came upon Wilhelm Reich’s concept of the ""sex economy,"" which he defined as the intentional squelching of sexual exchanges among German youth for the purpose of promoting conformity. I saw a similar inhibiting trend in our culture, applied to simple affection and love, and called it the ""stroke economy.""\n\nThe stroke economy creates a scarcity of love and affection by imposing a set of rules that govern the exchange of strokes. \n\nThe rules of the stroke economy are:\n\nDon’t give strokes you would like to give.\n\nDon’t ask for strokes you would like to get. \n\nDon’t accept strokes you would like to accept.\n\nDon’t reject strokes you don’t want.\n\nDon’t give yourself strokes.\n\nThese rules are enforced internally and externally. Internally, by what we, in transactional analysis, call the inner Critical Parent. The Critical Parent is an ego state and as such it represents a network of ideas, acquired in childhood which deeply affect love of ourselves and others. These ideas can be seen as ingrained neural networks; ""limbic attractors"" that shape every emotional experience according to an archaic blueprint.\n\nWhile loving patterns are set in childhood, later relationships in which the person establishes a limbic resonance with another are capable of restructuring  the original design. Lewis et al conclude that permanent beneficial restructuring of a persons deeply ingrained limbic brain patterns is possible through long-term individual psychotherapy with a therapist who, for all intents and purposes, needs to be a paragon of limbic virtue."
2,"What is the definition of ""sleet?""? As opposed to hail. Here's more than you probably ever wanted to know about sleet.\nDefinitions of sleet on the Web:\n\n    * precipitate as a mixture of rain and snow; ""If the temperature rises above freezing, it will probably sleet""\n    * partially melted snow (or a mixture of rain and snow)\n      wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn\n\n    * Whereas hail forms within clouds, sleet begins as snow falling to earth after having left its originating cloud. The snow partially melts on its trip down in a layer of warm air but then refreezes into ice crystals that appear much like hail.\n      en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleet\n\n    * Depending on the region, precipitation of rain or snow mixed, or rain and hail, or rain and ice pellets, or melting snow, or sudden and brief rainfall with wind and hail.\n      www.palmbeachdailynews.com/weather/content/shared/weather/weather_glossary.html\n\n    * Rain that turns to ice pellets before reaching the ground.

Also called ice pellets. Forms when snow enters a warm layer of air above the surface and melts and then enters a deep layer of sub freezing air on the surface and refreezes.\n      www.weca.org/nws-terms.html\n\n    * Describes solid grains of ice formed by the freezing of raindrops or the refreezing of largely melted snowflakes. These grains usually bounce upon impact with the ground or pavement. Heavy sleet is a relatively rare event defined as an accumulation of ice pellets covering the ground to a depth of 1/2"" or more. See Ice Pellets.\n      www.srh.weather.gov/srh/jetstream/append/glossary_s.htm\n\n    * also called ice pellets. Sleet is formed when raindrops or melted snowflakes freeze as they pass through a below-freezing layer of air near the earth's surface. Sleet does not normally stick to trees and wires, and usually bounces on hitting the ground. An accumulation of sleet often has the consistency of dry sand.\n      www.sws.uiuc.edu/atmos/statecli/Winter/glossary.htm\n\n    * Frozen or partially frozen rain that form when rain passes through a layer of air that is below the freezing temperature, falls to earth as a slush.

Colloquial usage of the term coincides with British usage, which defines sleet as a mixture of rain and snow.\n      www.pnl.gov/atmos_sciences/Cdw/Glossary.html\n\n    * Frozen precipitation that results when rain drops freeze while falling, before hitting the ground.

A point dipole with dipole moment ""p"" is located at a distance ""l"" from an infinite conducting plane.Find the modulus of the vector of electric interaction force acting on the dipole if the dipole moment vector is perpendicular to the plane.Please help me here along with the concepts applied here. I'm assuming this is an electric dipole.\n\nSince a dipole can be modeled as a pair of opposite charges +_q separated by a small displacement, you can use the method of images and assume the field produced by the conductor is the same as the original dipole reflected across the plane with the signs of the charges reversed. That means the image dipole is in the same orientation as the original dipole and is at a distance r = 2I from it. The force is attractive (towards the plane). The energy between two dipoles having the same moment p parallel to their separation vector is:\n\nW = -2p^2/r^3\n\nwhere r is the separation distance. The force between two such real dipoles would be (i.e. this is the force on either one):\n\nF = dW/dr = -6p^2/r^4\n\nThis should be the same force experienced by the one dipole in the field produced by the conducting plane. Since r = 2I, this is:\n\nF = (3/8)p^2/I^4"

Assume you have the background, social and religious commitment to marriage.? arranged marriage is one in which you marry someone because you think their background and family and personality is really suitable for you and that you have a great chance of loving that person and staying with that person for ever.  You need to have sufficient religious and cultural image about the sancity of a marriage and the social support to make it work.  you dont spend a lot of time dating, typically less than a year, sometimes a couple of months, you are typically introduced by parents. most often the person you marry is significantly better than one you could meet otherwise, i.e, through normal course of life, but you have either social or cultural or parental preasure to marry or move on to another girl, so you get married.  Can two nice people who have the right approach to resolving differences be in love for a lifetime just because they are both have  the right background, is it any different if you marry someone by trying it out first ? I have had this convo many times with people of those backgrounds that believe in it. From what I know they actually have a higher sucess rate than the ""normal' marriages... I was shocked because my first thought would be that it doesnt work but then I thought about it and it made sense. \n\nReligions that believe in that sort of thing are quite diffrent from americans in there perspetives on morals and etc... so I think their way of living makes them have better odds..

A boy was at a carnival and went to a booth where a man said to the boy, ""If I write your exact weight on this piece of paper then you have to give me $50, but if I cannot, I will pay you $50.""\n\nThe boy looked around and saw no scale so he agrees, thinking no matter what the carny writes he'll just say he weighs more or less.\n\nIn the end the boy ended up paying the man $50. How did the man win the bet? The man wrote ""Your exact weight"" on the paper."
2,"How do planes fly upside down? I understand that a combination of Bernoulli's theorem and the shape of a wing's cross section allow a plane to fly right way up, but when a wing is inverted, using the same logic, the plane should be fall to the ground. Obviously it doesn't, so my question is how does it stay in the air? More than Bernoulli's principle and wing shape (airfoil) are at work in keeping a plane in the air. The main criteria is the  ""angle of attack"" of the wing. That is, the angle at which the wing meets the air passing by it. When a plane is flying, its wing is always at a positive angle of attack; the leading edge of the wing is higher relative to the air going over it than the trailing edge. So the air pushes the wing up.  When the plane is inverted, the angle of attack must be great enough to overcome the ""negative lift""  created by the airfoil. This is accomplished by adjusting the elevator. Inverted flight will always require the input of down elevator."

The room is private, well decorated, and some even have a bar, food, and cigars. Champagne is sold by the glass or bottle. Many clubs have bouncers or cameras to make sure there is ""no sex in the champagne room"" while other clubs are notorious for allowing prostitution."

In some contry they try to filter some sites to make sure that no  customer can visit it I want to know can some one pass  all filters ? people say with piroxy we can ? but i want to know exactly how? The easiest way is to use a web based proxy, one where you go to a website and tell it the site you want to go to and it takes you there.  The people who are blocking the content only can tell that you went the the proxy site but will not know where you went using that. I have listed some below. You can also configure your computer to automatically use a proxy server. The directions to do this are below.\n\n1.On the Tools menu in Internet Explorer, click Internet Options, click the Connections tab, and then click LAN Settings.\n\n2.Under Proxy server, click to select the Use a proxy server for your LAN check box.\n\n3.In the Address box, type the IP address of the proxy server.\n\n4.In the Port box, type the port number that is used by the proxy server for client connections (by default, 8080).\n\n5.You can click to select the Bypass proxy server for local addresses check box if you do not want the proxy server computer to be used when you connect to a computer on the local network (this may speed up performance).\n\n6.Click OK to close the LAN Settings dialog box.\n7.Click OK again to close the Internet Options dialog box.\n\n\nThere are both anonymous proxies and ones that are not anonymous. Both will get you buy the ""firewall"" that you seem to have.  Using an anonymous proxy prevents the website that you are browsing from knowing who you are, they think that you are the proxy server.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. \nA proxy server is a computer network service that allows clients to make indirect network connections to other network services. A client connects to the proxy server, then requests a connection, file, or other resource available on a different server. The proxy provides the resource either by connecting to the specified server or by serving it from a cache. In some cases, the proxy may alter the client's request or the server's response for various purposes."

The next quarter of the course will take T/2 minutes, the next eight will takeT/4 minutes, and, in general the portion  from 1/2^n to ½^n+1 will take T/2^n minutes. The sum of all these time intervals may be indicated symbolically by writing the following expression:\n\n         T+T/2+T/4+…….+T/2^n +……..\nThis it clearly an infinite serie, but our physical experience tells us that a runner who travels at a constant speed should reach his goal in twice the time it takes for him to reach the halfway point. ****Edit to clarify******\nWhile the professor below is correct, and the poster below him is partially correct, you can only assume that the course is complete if you include the finite answer as an infinate series.\n\nThe prime example of this is that 1.999 repeating is NOT equal to 2.0 unless 2.0 is infinite, ie 2.000000 repeating.  You can not deal with unlike in infinate numbers.  Ie, you can not translate an infinite number to a finite number and still have the same premise.  \n\nSo unless the data deals with an infinate equality, the runner never will reach his destination.\n*********end edit***********\n\nWhile it is true that the runner will finish the course, as we know that every course has a start and ending point; in regards to math, unless the start and end are constants and predefined, the answer is simple:  THe runner will never reach the end.  The reason for this is that without a predefined set of start and end, the course is continous."

Few states require lunch or rest breaks, if any.  I know that for most employees over the age of 18 in even more politically liberal states like New Jersey do not require rest breaks.  Of course, many states regulate such for minors, but few for workers over the age of 18.\n\nI've included a link to a Department of Labor chart that gives requirements for each state on meal breaks.  It's a pretty short list: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, and West Virginia.\n\nFor rest breaks, the list shrinks to California, Colorad, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.\n\nPerhaps few regulate is because most employers voluntarily give rest breaks to employees to make work more bearable.  Perhaps few regulate because unions, often providing the strongest labor law components in states, don't really care if non-unionized labor is forced to receive breaks, but really works hard to ensure that its own members are protected through contract agreements and bargaining.  Regardless, I hope this information helps."

7,"How to combat competition which underprices well below margins and has no business ethics? The competition even goes to the extent of bribing the purchase dept and using other cheap methods for getting orders . In my experience, companies like this eventually get their's in the long run...generally if they lack ethics in their dealings with clients they also lack it internally...in their Accounting and Finance and HR functions too. You have seen a lot of companies who acted this way make headlines within the past few years (Enron, Worldcom, Lucent, etc), so we know that it does eventually does catch up with them...\n\nHowever, none of that solves your short-term dilemma so what I would recommend is a multi-part strategy that includes a lot of emphasis on what you do well. Differentiate your products, differentiate your services, stand head-and-shoulders over your competition in providing a great experience. Sure you could try to compete on margins, but in the end that only makes you have to sell harder and faster and could eventually bankrupt the company. \n\nI believe that just as there is room for cheaper and faster there is also room for creating a great buying / purchasing experience. Why else would companies like Mercedes Benz, Audi and BMW be around? They don't try to compete with Honda, Hyundai and Nissan. They cater to a specific clientele and show the value of their products...from the sales process to the service cycle, I think a similar approach, while a lot of work may be the only way to compete effectively.\n\nIf you spend your time fighting competitors like you have described above you waste valuable time that you could be better servicing your existing clients. Focus on them and they will in turn become your best source of leads and word of mouth advertising."

Carrying him and dancing (gently) are also fun and good for you too. Read, for a short time, every day. Your library surely has sturdy board books with colorful pictures to look at. \nTake him outside and help him explore around the yard, park, wherever. \nAt that age it takes time to absorb new information, so don't rush, take your time and repeat things that hold his attention.\nSee what your son responds to best.\nThe games you play now will not be much fun for you but the relationship and mental foundation you are builidng now will pay off later.

Historical, meaning that you can trace the origin throughtout time of the church to the 12 Apostle to Jesus Christ. The Catholic Church is NOT the first Christian church and is certainly not the one that Christ established or would have approved of. Their teachings, practices, and doctrines are not in harmony with the scriptures that Christ cherished so dearly. In the first century Christian congregation there was no allowance for a pope, there was no blasphemous teaching of a trinity, and Mary certainly wasn't venerated as she is today.\n\nPeter is not the ""rock"" that Christ was referring to. Catholics always tend to get this scripture incorrect. The context (the surrounding verses) are speaking about Jesus Christ, not Peter. Christ was simply talking to Peter about it, not making Peter the cornerstone of the congregation because Jesus himself is the head of the congregation."

I tried it, and now I'm sticking to it for these reasons:\n\n1. I have a high resolution monitor making it hard to see pictures & text.  In Firefox, I can zoom pictures & text.\n\n2. Sometimes I view foreign websites, and I use a built-in translator to translate the whole website in 1-click.\n\n3. You can open new pages in tabs, so it looks cleaner.\n\n4. There is a portable version of Firefox that I can put on a flash drive & surf with all my bookmarks & settings on a public computer.  Then I don't have to worry about clearing cookies & history after I'm done since I'm surfing off my flash drive.  http://portableapps.com/\n\n5. You can customize Firefox to do different things that IE doesn't support yet, using extensions here: https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/\n\n...and finally...\n\n6. I hate Microsoft."

2,"Why 220V amplitude for domestic ac circuits? In India, we use 220V as the amplitude of the sinusoidal ac current in our houses. The reasons for choosing this particularly odd value are historical. But my question is - what? What is the reason for this convention? I could suggest several considerations.  First P=IE, that is Power equals the electrical current (I in Amperes) times the voltage (E in volts).  Current is like the flow of water in a pipe and voltage is like the pressure causing the water to flow.  If you use the water to drive a hydraulic piston (say to hoist an automobile for repair) you can use either a small piston and high pressure or a larger piston and lower pressure.  Which is more cost effective?\n\nIn the United States, electric power is delivered to neighborhoods using three wires (three phases) strung along telephone (power) poles.  Only two of the wires are led to a single residence but the neighborhood must use all three wires to balance load on the wires.  Within a house electricity passes from only one wire (phase) to ground or earth to light a lightbulb which uses 110 volts.  The clothes dryer that needs far more power is connected between two of the supply wires (two phase) and to ground to supply 220 volts.  A machine shop might connect a very large motor to all three supply wires to obtain even more power at 440 volts.\n\nSix volts or even 12 volts DC in an automobile circuit can be touched with little danger.  It is less dangerous to accidentally touch a 110 volt AC wire than a 220 volt source and 440 volts is most dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the selection of voltage depends in part on safety and then on the size of the job to be tackled and also economic factors.  The higher the required current, the larger the required wires using expensive copper.  Increasing the voltage reduces the needed current and reduces the needed copper to do a given job.  The higher the required voltage, the more expensive the required electrical insulation will be.  Engineers must determine the best trade off of many factors."

10,"Do our representatives retain any honesty/integrity once they are elected into office? Who can we trust? It seems that the longer they are in office, the more influence they gain, but the more they seem to be seduced by the power they control.  Of course the only way to retain it is to stay in office, and that means money.  The temptation to take help from wealthy special interests is almost too much to resist.  Then, of course, begins the slippery slide down from integrity to political punch line.\n\nThis doesn't mean that all politicians are corrupt; it just means it's pretty hard to tell which ones are honest and which aren't.\n\nThe problem is how to fix it--if it ever is.  The only way is with REAL campaign finance reform that completely changes the way candidates get money.  But such change must be enacted by Congress, and there's just too much self-interest involved to get any real change enacted.  So there you go..."

It is the state of having enough money to live your life the way you desire for the rest of your life.\n\nThis can be a large dollar amount if you like to spend a lot of money, Donald Trump, for example, or a small one, if you are a priest, for example.\n\nEveryone's financial goal should be to save and invest to get to their own personal Critical Mass amount."

1,"What is the majority sentiment when it comes to the Gospel according to Thomas and other gnostic writings? Is it true ,in the Gospel according to Thomas ,that it eludes to that fact that Jesus was just a man? No, Thomas does not allude to the fact that Jesus was just a man.  The concept in fact would be contrary to most Gnostic believes.  Here's a quick quote from Thomas:\n\n(77) Jesus says:\n(1) ""I am the light that is over all. I am the All.\nThe All came forth out of me. And to me the All has come.""\n(2) ""Split a piece of wood – I am there.\n(3) Lift the stone, and you will find me there.""\n\nThomas is a ""sayings gospel.""  Unlike the Gospels that are in the Bible, it has no narrative.  It is just one Jesus quote after another.  Many scholars assign a first century date to Thomas, so it is at least possible that it is very old.\n\nGnostics believe that the material world is evil, and therefore God would never take the form of a man.  Gnostics have what is called a docetic view of Christ.  That is that he only appeared to be human, and had none of the actual physical characteristics of a human.  The goal of Gnostics is to escape the limitations and evil of this physical world and return to the spiritual world they believe we came from.\n\nGnosis.org is a great resource for gnostic information and has several copies of the Gospel of Thomas"

There are a number of ways to take screen shots.  The built in way of using either ctrl-print screen or alt-print screen (for the focused window only) is the easiet.  This puts a graphic of the screen or window in the clipboard.  To access them, simply paste the clipboard into the paint program or any other program that can handle a picture paste function.  (simply open a new document and paste from the edit menu.)  A tool to make the clipboard more friendly might help out with this.  Or a 3rd party screen capture utility could help better too.  Check this web page for such programs."

When your computer is getting itself going, the BIOS usually places a brief message on the screen telling you how to activate the BIOS setup menu to show up. The message might say something like this: ""Press F2 for setup."" (F2 is just used as an example.)\n\n   The idea is simple, but the execution sometimes can be frustrating. You have to press the key before the BIOS finishes starting up the PC. I usually get my timing right, but sometimes I have to keep hitting the right key a few dozen times before the BIOS notices all my efforts. \n\nOnce you are in your BIOS toggle through the screens until you see where you can can disable your L1 and L2 Caches.\n\nExit and Save.\n\nYour caches will be disabled."

Auld's been so strong all season that I think it's wise for Vancouver to let this young goalie see lots of action and face the season.  He's performed nicely in his role so far, and he should mature quickly if he becomes the #1 goalie this season."
